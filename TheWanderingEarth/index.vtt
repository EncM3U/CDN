1
00:01:04.458 --> 00:01:05.197
Hurry up!

2
00:01:05.208 --> 00:01:06.823
Look! It's Jupiter!

3
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.456
The largest planet in the solar system.

4
00:01:12.083 --> 00:01:13.118
Dad.

5
00:01:13.125 --> 00:01:15.116
There is an eye on Jupiter.

6
00:01:15.625 --> 00:01:17.581
That's a huge windstorm on Jupiter.

7
00:01:17.583 --> 00:01:19.448
What's a windstorm?

8
00:01:19.458 --> 00:01:21.949
Jupiter is like a huge balloon.

9
00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.165
Composed of 90% hydrogen.

10
00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:26.783
Grandpa. What's hydrogen?

11
00:01:27.042 --> 00:01:28.282
What is hydrogen?

12
00:01:31.667 --> 00:01:32.998
Hydrogen is

13
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.161
the fuel for dad's rocket.

14
00:01:35.167 --> 00:01:36.167
I see.

15
00:01:36.292 --> 00:01:37.452
Liu qi.

16
00:01:37.458 --> 00:01:38.458
Yes?

17
00:01:38.625 --> 00:01:39.956
A day may come

18
00:01:40.625 --> 00:01:43.583
when you can see Jupiter
without a telescope...

19
00:01:43.917 --> 00:01:45.248
That's when dad will come back.

20
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.286
Where are you going?

21
00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:50.623
Dad is going on a mission.

22
00:01:51.167 --> 00:01:53.203
The most important mission in the world.

23
00:01:57.917 --> 00:01:59.578
After I leave.

24
00:01:59.583 --> 00:02:01.494
You'll be liu qi's only custodian.

25
00:02:03.083 --> 00:02:04.493
You shall obtain the right

26
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.663
of underground city residency
without drawing the lots.

27
00:02:08.375 --> 00:02:09.831
And it is the only way

28
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.706
to ensure that both you and liu qi

29
00:02:14.083 --> 00:02:15.493
will survive.

30
00:02:18.417 --> 00:02:19.372
This is the only choice...

31
00:02:19.375 --> 00:02:21.411
That's enough. I get it.

32
00:02:31.458 --> 00:02:32.573
Father.

33
00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.619
Sorry.

34
00:02:43.083 --> 00:02:44.118
At first.

35
00:02:44.125 --> 00:02:46.912
Nobody cared about this disaster.

36
00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:49.408
It's just another wildfire.

37
00:02:51.667 --> 00:02:53.077
Another drought.

38
00:02:55.792 --> 00:02:57.498
Another extinction of species.

39
00:03:01.292 --> 00:03:03.203
Another vanishing city.

40
00:03:04.542 --> 00:03:08.615
Until everyone is entwined
with this disaster.

41
00:03:10.583 --> 00:03:14.906
The sun is rapidly
degenerating and expanding.

42
00:03:15.083 --> 00:03:19.326
The sun will engulf earth in 100 years.

43
00:03:20.542 --> 00:03:24.740
The solar system will
no longer exist in 300 years.

44
00:03:27.708 --> 00:03:29.824
To face this coming
cataclysmic catastrophe.

45
00:03:29.833 --> 00:03:32.870
Mankind united like never seen before.

46
00:03:33.833 --> 00:03:36.074
In order to maximize the
chance of human survival.

47
00:03:36.375 --> 00:03:40.573
The united earth government
or the ueg decided to propel earth out of

48
00:03:40.708 --> 00:03:43.996
the solar system to fly towards our new
home located 4.2 light years away.

49
00:03:44.667 --> 00:03:47.659
This mighty and enduring

50
00:03:47.667 --> 00:03:49.282
human migration

51
00:03:49.292 --> 00:03:52.125
is named as the wandering earth project.

52
00:03:53.167 --> 00:03:55.158
Mankind will devote every possible resource

53
00:03:55.167 --> 00:03:58.864
to construct 10.000 earth engines
on the planet's surface

54
00:03:58.875 --> 00:04:02.163
to propel earth out of the solar system.

55
00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.700
The height of every propulsion engine
is 11.000 meters.

56
00:04:05.708 --> 00:04:08.780
They will provide a total
of 150 trillion propulsive force for earth.

57
00:04:09.167 --> 00:04:10.167
Salute!

58
00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:12.073
The construction of navigation platform
international space station

59
00:04:12.083 --> 00:04:13.994
will be completed early this month.

60
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.582
There are 311 Chinese senior pilots

61
00:04:16.583 --> 00:04:18.995
and 709 engineers that were selected.

62
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:20.956
Ignite.

63
00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.323
Meanwhile.

64
00:04:22.333 --> 00:04:24.790
To safeguard earth's trajectory.

65
00:04:24.792 --> 00:04:27.624
The united earth government consolidated
global astronautical capabilities

66
00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:31.948
and spent 30 years to build the navigation
platform international space station.

67
00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:36.456
The navigation platform
international space station will travel

68
00:04:36.458 --> 00:04:39.370
with a relative position
of 100.000 km to earth.

69
00:04:39.417 --> 00:04:43.490
It will provide warnings. Navigations.
And communications for earth.

70
00:04:49.292 --> 00:04:51.783
Centrifugal drive activated.

71
00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:55.329
Worldwide sea level will rise
300 meters within 10 years.

72
00:04:55.333 --> 00:04:58.253
Haikou and zhanjiang of our country
will be attacked by the Tsunami first.

73
00:04:58.375 --> 00:05:00.912
To deal with the continuous
deteriorating condition.

74
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.491
Ueg constructed one adjacent city

75
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.082
beneath each earth engine.

76
00:05:07.125 --> 00:05:09.707
Before earth's arrival at its new home.

77
00:05:09.708 --> 00:05:11.448
These will be the only refuge for mankind.

78
00:05:11.458 --> 00:05:15.531
The right to underground residency
will be obtained by drawing lots.

79
00:05:15.542 --> 00:05:17.703
The lottery result can't be transferred.
Borrowed. Or gifted.

80
00:05:17.708 --> 00:05:19.869
Till now. Mankind.

81
00:05:19.875 --> 00:05:22.867
A tiny tribe in the solar system.

82
00:05:23.125 --> 00:05:25.537
Will be embarking upon 2.500 years

83
00:05:25.542 --> 00:05:27.078
of wandering voyage.

84
00:05:27.708 --> 00:05:30.871
The surface temperature will drop to
minus 70 degrees celsius this year.

85
00:05:30.875 --> 00:05:33.787
All surface residents from different

86
00:05:35.375 --> 00:05:37.707
- slowly.
- Don't push!

87
00:05:56.542 --> 00:05:58.282
Dad will fly up into the sky

88
00:05:58.917 --> 00:06:00.532
and turn into a star

89
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.410
to always watch over you.

90
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:05.365
Dad.

91
00:06:05.375 --> 00:06:08.572
Are you really going to turn into a star?

92
00:06:09.125 --> 00:06:10.125
Of course.

93
00:06:10.917 --> 00:06:13.499
From now on. You just have to count

94
00:06:14.042 --> 00:06:15.042
three.

95
00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:16.667
Two.

96
00:06:17.333 --> 00:06:18.493
One.

97
00:06:19.125 --> 00:06:20.125
Look up!

98
00:06:21.042 --> 00:06:22.657
You will see dad.

99
00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.287
Goodbye, solar system.

100
00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.040
Goodbye, solar system.

101
00:06:40.042 --> 00:06:42.454
Au revoir, systéme solaire.

102
00:07:01.417 --> 00:07:03.373
Welcome to the morning news.

103
00:07:03.375 --> 00:07:05.081
Today's headlines are...

104
00:07:05.333 --> 00:07:07.073
During the arrival of spring.

105
00:07:07.083 --> 00:07:10.621
The first batch of personnel on the
navigation platform will be returning.

106
00:07:10.625 --> 00:07:13.913
Completing 15 to 20 years
of station duties.

107
00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:18.869
All underground citizens of the globe
are eagerly anticipating their arrivals.

108
00:07:18.917 --> 00:07:20.453
Therefore...

109
00:08:07.458 --> 00:08:10.416
Anticipating.

110
00:08:10.417 --> 00:08:11.998
Spring breeze has arrived.

111
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.616
The spring is near.

112
00:08:14.625 --> 00:08:17.241
The yearly planning starts with spring.

113
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.081
It's full of effort.

114
00:08:19.083 --> 00:08:20.573
It's full of hope.

115
00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:22.073
Tell us. Monitor.

116
00:08:22.083 --> 00:08:23.664
How do you define hope?

117
00:08:24.167 --> 00:08:29.957
Hope is precious like a
diamond for our time.

118
00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:34.076
Hope is the only direction of our home.

119
00:08:34.083 --> 00:08:35.789
Well said. Please seat.

120
00:08:35.792 --> 00:08:38.283
Han duoduo. Do you have any thoughts?

121
00:08:38.667 --> 00:08:40.077
I have nothing to say.

122
00:08:41.292 --> 00:08:43.408
I just want to take a look outside.

123
00:08:43.417 --> 00:08:45.453
But it's too dangerous outside.

124
00:08:48.542 --> 00:08:50.123
Xiao ming. Be seated. Class.

125
00:08:50.125 --> 00:08:52.161
Don't panic. It's just
a display malfunction.

126
00:08:52.167 --> 00:08:52.576
Go. Let's go.

127
00:08:52.583 --> 00:08:54.744
Xiao ming. Go back.

128
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.581
Stay in order.

129
00:08:59.125 --> 00:09:00.160
Did you do this?

130
00:09:00.167 --> 00:09:01.031
Shut up! Let's move!

131
00:09:01.042 --> 00:09:02.122
Teacher.

132
00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:04.161
Han duoduo has run away!

133
00:09:04.167 --> 00:09:07.739
- Happy new year!
- Happy new year!

134
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:10.537
Hu kou. Committee is giving
out dumplings tonight?

135
00:09:11.083 --> 00:09:12.163
All you think about is food!

136
00:09:12.167 --> 00:09:13.156
Where is grandpa's vehicle pass?

137
00:09:13.167 --> 00:09:14.998
I've got it.

138
00:09:15.625 --> 00:09:17.331
Shall we grab the dumplings
before we leave?

139
00:09:17.333 --> 00:09:18.118
Eat dirt! Don't go then!

140
00:09:18.125 --> 00:09:20.036
Liar!

141
00:09:20.042 --> 00:09:22.374
You said you'll take me outside.

142
00:09:24.167 --> 00:09:27.204
All personnel. Return to your post.

143
00:09:30.375 --> 00:09:32.286
Durian-flavored dried earthworms!

144
00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:34.035
What are you looking at?

145
00:09:34.042 --> 00:09:35.407
It's just a day trip.

146
00:09:35.417 --> 00:09:36.702
What's the rush?

147
00:09:36.708 --> 00:09:37.948
That's what it is to you.

148
00:09:38.083 --> 00:09:39.664
I'm not planning on returning.

149
00:09:41.375 --> 00:09:43.457
Going nowhere without the suits.

150
00:09:44.375 --> 00:09:48.448
You had the mahjong I needed.
Why didn't you discard it?

151
00:09:48.458 --> 00:09:49.914
Isn't bunny girl's

152
00:09:49.917 --> 00:09:51.782
tail soft and sweet?

153
00:09:51.792 --> 00:09:54.579
Aren't we meant to be each others' angel?

154
00:09:54.583 --> 00:09:56.619
What are you doing here? It's the new year!

155
00:09:56.625 --> 00:09:59.082
How cheeky you are!

156
00:10:01.333 --> 00:10:02.333
Hey.

157
00:10:02.792 --> 00:10:03.792
Go.

158
00:10:04.583 --> 00:10:05.948
Yi ge.

159
00:10:09.083 --> 00:10:10.083
Yi ge.

160
00:10:10.792 --> 00:10:12.407
Are the suits ready?

161
00:10:13.125 --> 00:10:14.706
The stuff I want?

162
00:10:16.667 --> 00:10:17.622
It's fairly new.

163
00:10:17.625 --> 00:10:18.660
All checked.

164
00:10:18.667 --> 00:10:19.952
Usable.

165
00:10:20.375 --> 00:10:22.286
And I got you skewers too.

166
00:10:22.292 --> 00:10:23.748
Eat while it is warm.

167
00:10:27.292 --> 00:10:28.327
Good.

168
00:10:36.417 --> 00:10:37.782
Grab your thermal suits.

169
00:10:55.042 --> 00:10:56.122
How old are you?

170
00:10:57.917 --> 00:10:59.327
Check out this tag yi ge made!

171
00:10:59.333 --> 00:11:01.824
Just like the real thing.

172
00:11:01.833 --> 00:11:02.322
Yours.

173
00:11:02.333 --> 00:11:03.573
Thanks. Yi ge.

174
00:11:05.292 --> 00:11:07.032
Return the suits tomorrow.

175
00:11:09.708 --> 00:11:11.369
Thanks. Yi ge. See you.

176
00:11:12.375 --> 00:11:13.160
Hurry up and move.

177
00:11:13.208 --> 00:11:14.197
Didn't you say you are not coming back?

178
00:11:14.208 --> 00:11:15.414
Wait.

179
00:11:19.417 --> 00:11:21.157
Not coming back?

180
00:11:22.083 --> 00:11:24.244
Are these all you paid me?

181
00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:26.206
For two of my thermal suits?

182
00:11:27.125 --> 00:11:28.956
Yi ge. I'll make it up when I get back.

183
00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.789
For years. I. Yi ge. Have been known

184
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.365
for honest trading only.

185
00:11:33.375 --> 00:11:35.115
No credits given!

186
00:11:35.125 --> 00:11:38.413
Yi ge. I really need to go out today.

187
00:11:41.292 --> 00:11:42.657
What for?

188
00:11:43.375 --> 00:11:45.866
Just stay here with your
sister for the new year.

189
00:11:49.458 --> 00:11:50.538
Hey. Boss. Look!

190
00:11:50.542 --> 00:11:52.123
Hyper?

191
00:11:53.083 --> 00:11:54.539
You stinky repairman.

192
00:11:54.542 --> 00:11:57.579
I dare you! Use it here...

193
00:12:01.083 --> 00:12:02.289
Duoduo. Get down.

194
00:12:09.167 --> 00:12:11.624
I want him dead!

195
00:12:13.417 --> 00:12:14.406
Dear friends.

196
00:12:14.417 --> 00:12:16.373
Let's open the door and embrace the spring.

197
00:12:16.667 --> 00:12:19.579
Joy shall follow you when you see one.

198
00:12:19.667 --> 00:12:20.622
A new year.

199
00:12:20.625 --> 00:12:22.616
With our heads up and walk tall.

200
00:12:22.667 --> 00:12:25.579
Marching toward to the
next spectacular chapter.

201
00:12:36.708 --> 00:12:38.289
- Excuse us.
- Excuse us.

202
00:12:42.917 --> 00:12:44.748
I dare you not to come back!

203
00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:46.500
What?

204
00:12:46.875 --> 00:12:48.206
Will they report us?

205
00:12:48.208 --> 00:12:49.789
These were obtained illegally.

206
00:12:49.792 --> 00:12:51.432
They'll expose themselves if they report.

207
00:12:53.042 --> 00:12:54.498
Well...

208
00:12:55.375 --> 00:12:56.956
This spring festival.

209
00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.994
You will spend it with me outside.

210
00:13:11.125 --> 00:13:15.368
Please check your thermal suit and helmet.
Please wait there.

211
00:13:22.125 --> 00:13:25.082
Miss. Can I chew gum with my helmet on?

212
00:13:25.083 --> 00:13:26.523
- Chew what?
- Shut up and come over!

213
00:13:31.625 --> 00:13:34.742
- In three days. We'll swing pass Jupiter.
- Attention!

214
00:13:35.125 --> 00:13:38.663
All transportation communication systems
must be turned on all the time.

215
00:13:38.833 --> 00:13:41.540
Follow evacuation instructions at any time.

216
00:13:52.083 --> 00:13:56.998
Please pay attention to reversing.

217
00:14:01.458 --> 00:14:03.494
Oh. My.

218
00:14:08.083 --> 00:14:09.573
Look at yourself.

219
00:14:09.583 --> 00:14:11.198
Is it your first time outside. Too?

220
00:14:11.417 --> 00:14:13.032
Haven't you been outside before?

221
00:14:13.042 --> 00:14:15.624
It wasn't this crowded last time.

222
00:14:15.625 --> 00:14:17.490
You are such a liar.

223
00:14:19.167 --> 00:14:21.374
How long will it take
to get to the surface?

224
00:14:21.375 --> 00:14:23.081
It's 5 km.

225
00:14:23.083 --> 00:14:25.699
So at least 15 minutes.

226
00:14:25.708 --> 00:14:26.708
Okay.

227
00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:39.990
This is a communication device.

228
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.786
Press once to sync with the transporter.

229
00:14:41.792 --> 00:14:43.157
Twice for regional broadcast.

230
00:14:43.167 --> 00:14:44.577
Three times for the private channel.

231
00:14:44.583 --> 00:14:45.572
Once outside.

232
00:14:45.583 --> 00:14:47.039
Stay close to me.

233
00:14:47.042 --> 00:14:48.202
Don't run around.

234
00:14:48.208 --> 00:14:49.414
Are you afraid?

235
00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:22.581
Surface level reached.

236
00:15:22.583 --> 00:15:25.655
All personnel. Please be ready.

237
00:16:00.667 --> 00:16:01.702
Let's go!

238
00:16:05.667 --> 00:16:07.373
Enough looking around?

239
00:16:07.375 --> 00:16:07.989
Let's go!

240
00:16:08.042 --> 00:16:09.202
I sneaked out.

241
00:16:09.208 --> 00:16:11.119
Am I getting expelled by the school?

242
00:16:11.125 --> 00:16:12.865
Have you already been
kicked out of your unit?

243
00:16:12.875 --> 00:16:15.116
Nonsense.

244
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.707
Which one is transporter 373?

245
00:16:21.042 --> 00:16:23.033
Duoduo. Come over!

246
00:16:25.917 --> 00:16:28.033
- Give me grandpa's vehicle pass.
- Here.

247
00:16:35.625 --> 00:16:36.489
Han ziang.

248
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.115
Senior driver.

249
00:16:38.125 --> 00:16:41.162
Beijing no. 3 transportation
division reminds you.

250
00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:42.953
Routes are countless.

251
00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:44.664
Safety is foremost.

252
00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:46.615
With unregulated driving.

253
00:16:46.667 --> 00:16:48.953
Your loved ones might end up in tears.

254
00:16:53.083 --> 00:16:54.118
Clutch.

255
00:16:54.417 --> 00:16:55.827
Gear.

256
00:17:00.458 --> 00:17:01.743
What the...

257
00:17:02.417 --> 00:17:03.827
Can you drive. Hu kou?

258
00:17:03.833 --> 00:17:05.789
This transporter is not for everyone!

259
00:17:05.792 --> 00:17:07.783
It requires at least
five years of training.

260
00:17:07.792 --> 00:17:09.657
I am genius enough just to make it move.
Okay?

261
00:17:09.667 --> 00:17:10.702
Genius.

262
00:17:10.708 --> 00:17:12.369
Step on the clutch. Hand on the gear.
Then move.

263
00:17:12.375 --> 00:17:14.491
Heavy step. Light hand and no commotion.

264
00:17:21.208 --> 00:17:22.568
Watch out! There are others ahead!

265
00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:24.243
Shit! Fuck!

266
00:17:34.833 --> 00:17:36.573
Watch out!

267
00:17:43.708 --> 00:17:47.030
The world outside is huge!

268
00:17:47.083 --> 00:17:50.155
What are you yelling about?
So embarrassing!

269
00:17:50.792 --> 00:17:52.623
Such strong winds today.

270
00:17:52.625 --> 00:17:54.616
Why are they mining these mountains?

271
00:17:54.625 --> 00:17:55.865
For fuel.

272
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.036
Heavy fusion propulsion technology.

273
00:17:58.042 --> 00:17:59.703
Basically.

274
00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:01.664
Basically. It's burning rocks.

275
00:18:01.667 --> 00:18:03.248
The earth engine!

276
00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:05.411
These are propulsion engines.

277
00:18:05.417 --> 00:18:08.864
There are 10.000 of them around the globe.
Made for pushing earth forward.

278
00:18:08.875 --> 00:18:10.411
This isn't the most gigantic one.

279
00:18:10.417 --> 00:18:12.282
Those torque engines along the equator.

280
00:18:12.292 --> 00:18:15.159
They are the real giants.

281
00:19:31.667 --> 00:19:33.908
Synchronal translation is on.

282
00:19:34.167 --> 00:19:35.327
Buddy.

283
00:19:35.667 --> 00:19:37.077
Happy retirement.

284
00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.206
One more day until I go home.

285
00:19:44.208 --> 00:19:45.573
Don't mess up my last dignity.

286
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.581
Save this moonshine for yourself.

287
00:19:47.625 --> 00:19:50.582
I will store it somewhere safe for you.

288
00:19:50.583 --> 00:19:52.619
Save it for your farewell party.

289
00:19:52.708 --> 00:19:55.199
We are not getting another chance
once we hibernate.

290
00:20:02.667 --> 00:20:04.407
Don't you know

291
00:20:04.417 --> 00:20:08.706
how vodka was smuggled up
during gagarin's time?

292
00:20:20.875 --> 00:20:22.911
We'll be entering Jupiter's
orbit today. Right?

293
00:20:22.917 --> 00:20:27.536
Yes. We have already stood by for
emergency protocol no. 3.

294
00:20:27.917 --> 00:20:29.999
Something doesn't feel right.

295
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.410
There's no other way. Earth can't

296
00:20:31.417 --> 00:20:33.032
leave the solar system
without utilizing Jupiter's gravity.

297
00:20:33.042 --> 00:20:34.498
It is a risk we must take.

298
00:20:34.583 --> 00:20:36.824
God will bless us.

299
00:20:37.583 --> 00:20:39.574
Once this is over. You can return home.

300
00:20:41.542 --> 00:20:43.498
It's the last procedure
for daily inspection.

301
00:20:43.958 --> 00:20:46.244
Check the centrifugal drive control unit.

302
00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:48.491
Record the temperatures
of centrifugal axle bearings.

303
00:20:51.667 --> 00:20:52.667
Understood.

304
00:21:02.375 --> 00:21:05.207
Liu peigiang has completed
handover procedure.

305
00:21:05.208 --> 00:21:06.789
Lieutenant colonel liu peigiang.

306
00:21:06.792 --> 00:21:07.827
Until today.

307
00:21:07.833 --> 00:21:10.700
You have accumulated a resting time
of 12 years and 3 days in total.

308
00:21:10.708 --> 00:21:13.575
An accumulated shift of 5
years and 14 days total.

309
00:21:13.583 --> 00:21:16.165
We are grateful for your contributions
for the past 17 years.

310
00:21:16.167 --> 00:21:19.364
Congratulations on your duty completion
and journey home tomorrow.

311
00:21:33.583 --> 00:21:34.583
Brother.

312
00:21:35.917 --> 00:21:38.954
See you on earth three years later.

313
00:21:39.167 --> 00:21:41.283
Go catch up with your son.

314
00:21:41.667 --> 00:21:43.623
You haven't spoken to him
for almost a decade.

315
00:21:48.542 --> 00:21:49.702
See you on earth.

316
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.581
Bro.

317
00:21:57.958 --> 00:22:00.950
You'll be spending
the next three years with me now.

318
00:22:23.167 --> 00:22:25.249
Jupiter's gravitational spike detected.

319
00:22:25.667 --> 00:22:28.739
Earth's trajectory is off
course by 9.23 degrees.

320
00:22:28.958 --> 00:22:30.949
Due to Jupiter's gravitational spike.

321
00:22:31.292 --> 00:22:34.034
The probability of colliding
with Jupiter increases.

322
00:22:34.042 --> 00:22:35.703
Analyzing data collected.

323
00:22:35.708 --> 00:22:37.790
Transmitting to the ueg

324
00:22:37.958 --> 00:22:40.950
disaster warning protocols activated.

325
00:22:50.125 --> 00:22:52.958
There's a supply depot 50 km ahead.

326
00:22:56.667 --> 00:22:58.077
Once we get there.

327
00:22:58.167 --> 00:22:59.532
You go back by yourself.

328
00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:01.831
Catch the earliest shuttle back.

329
00:23:01.833 --> 00:23:03.789
So grandpa won't worry about us.

330
00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:05.581
Oh. Come on.

331
00:23:05.583 --> 00:23:08.575
You would be clenched by the collar
once your dad gets back.

332
00:23:09.167 --> 00:23:12.364
I'm a genius. No one is
capable of clenching me.

333
00:23:12.792 --> 00:23:13.907
What the...

334
00:23:13.917 --> 00:23:15.282
Car inspection.

335
00:23:17.167 --> 00:23:18.532
How did you get in here?

336
00:23:18.792 --> 00:23:19.451
Unregulated...

337
00:23:19.458 --> 00:23:20.664
Unregulated driving.

338
00:23:20.667 --> 00:23:21.656
Unregulated?

339
00:23:21.667 --> 00:23:22.907
You committed thievery!

340
00:23:22.917 --> 00:23:25.374
I didn't steal. I just borrowed it.
It's my grandpa's vehicle pass.

341
00:23:25.375 --> 00:23:28.447
Nonsense. All transporters belong to
the ueg as public properties.

342
00:23:28.458 --> 00:23:30.574
It's not up to your grandpa!

343
00:23:32.708 --> 00:23:33.993
What are you doing?

344
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:34.864
It's way past bedtime!

345
00:23:34.875 --> 00:23:35.990
Sir.

346
00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:38.616
I'm just getting to know new friends.

347
00:23:38.625 --> 00:23:40.866
More friends. More options.

348
00:23:40.875 --> 00:23:42.456
Hand over.

349
00:23:43.417 --> 00:23:44.907
You think it is yours?

350
00:23:44.917 --> 00:23:46.657
Hit the sack.

351
00:23:47.708 --> 00:23:48.948
Have a nice stroll.

352
00:23:50.417 --> 00:23:51.782
I am Tim.

353
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:54.616
My dad is from Beijing.
And my mom is from Melbourne.

354
00:23:54.625 --> 00:23:55.535
A Chinese and Australian joint product.

355
00:23:55.542 --> 00:23:56.952
Come on. I was just joking.

356
00:23:56.958 --> 00:23:58.289
Let's shake hands?

357
00:24:02.417 --> 00:24:03.406
Hello.

358
00:24:03.417 --> 00:24:04.827
Joint product.

359
00:24:04.833 --> 00:24:06.198
It hurts. Let go of me.

360
00:24:06.208 --> 00:24:07.208
It hurts!

361
00:24:17.708 --> 00:24:19.573
Name of the visitor?

362
00:24:20.333 --> 00:24:21.539
Han ziang.

363
00:24:21.708 --> 00:24:24.370
I'm here for my grandson.

364
00:24:42.125 --> 00:24:44.036
Someone's getting bailed.

365
00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:50.706
Sir.

366
00:24:50.708 --> 00:24:52.619
My grandson is a mechanic trainee.

367
00:24:52.625 --> 00:24:54.115
He just wanted to touch the real thing.

368
00:24:54.125 --> 00:24:57.492
May you go easy on him.

369
00:24:58.667 --> 00:25:01.374
Transporters are highly
valuable public property.

370
00:25:02.083 --> 00:25:05.996
Lending out your vehicle pass privately
is also a serious offense.

371
00:25:09.958 --> 00:25:11.914
This is good stuff.

372
00:25:12.042 --> 00:25:14.203
It has a collection of hotties
from the past 50 years.

373
00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:16.115
It's all in.

374
00:25:18.125 --> 00:25:19.240
Oh. Well.

375
00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:23.615
Same old trick.

376
00:25:40.958 --> 00:25:42.573
Stop wobbling. Old man!

377
00:25:48.833 --> 00:25:50.494
What old man?

378
00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.582
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.

379
00:25:52.583 --> 00:25:53.493
Running away from home.

380
00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:55.206
You're too old to be running away.

381
00:25:55.208 --> 00:25:56.163
He is your father anyhow.

382
00:25:56.167 --> 00:25:57.373
Where are you going to hide?

383
00:25:57.375 --> 00:25:58.740
You even brought your little sister out?

384
00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:01.036
Outside is dangerous!

385
00:26:01.375 --> 00:26:02.785
And you!

386
00:26:05.083 --> 00:26:07.039
You've learned to steal!

387
00:26:08.583 --> 00:26:09.868
You stole my pass!

388
00:26:09.875 --> 00:26:11.991
Should you do whatever
your brother told you to do?

389
00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:13.581
Are you dumb?

390
00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.036
I didn't intend to bring her along.
But she was begging me...

391
00:26:16.042 --> 00:26:17.532
As a brother...

392
00:26:17.542 --> 00:26:18.542
To take her.

393
00:26:18.625 --> 00:26:20.786
Liu qi! You liar!

394
00:26:20.792 --> 00:26:22.123
Here she goes again.

395
00:26:22.125 --> 00:26:23.786
Nicely said!

396
00:26:23.792 --> 00:26:25.453
Ignore senior's advice...

397
00:26:25.458 --> 00:26:27.039
Mind your own business!

398
00:26:27.042 --> 00:26:28.122
Don't take it out on the wall.

399
00:26:28.125 --> 00:26:30.332
Take it out on me if you dare.

400
00:26:30.333 --> 00:26:32.369
What the...

401
00:26:39.667 --> 00:26:40.326
Earthquake!

402
00:26:40.333 --> 00:26:41.618
Shi San yao!

403
00:26:41.625 --> 00:26:42.956
I won!

404
00:26:59.417 --> 00:27:00.532
Open the door!

405
00:27:00.542 --> 00:27:02.123
Anyone?

406
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:03.581
Open the door!

407
00:27:03.583 --> 00:27:05.323

408
00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:09.832

409
00:27:13.583 --> 00:27:14.493

414
00:27:26.333 --> 00:27:28.164
Don't leave me!

415
00:27:28.167 --> 00:27:30.704
Help! Is anyone there?

416
00:27:30.708 --> 00:27:32.915
My mom needs me and my kid...

417
00:27:32.917 --> 00:27:34.828
I don't even have a kid yet!

418
00:27:34.833 --> 00:27:35.948
Hey!

419
00:27:35.958 --> 00:27:37.698
Please help me. Man.

420
00:27:37.708 --> 00:27:39.198

421
00:27:39.208 --> 00:27:40.948

Grab the key.

423
00:27:42.083 --> 00:27:44.495
The key! The key is pinned underneath.

424
00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.912
What's this? You can't pull this apart!

425
00:27:51.375 --> 00:27:53.081
Hurry up!

426
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:55.035
Wait for me.

427
00:28:20.667 --> 00:28:22.498
Engine no. 7 has stopped.

428
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.206
Engine no. 3 has stopped.

429
00:28:24.542 --> 00:28:27.909
Get the chief engineer! Quick!

430
00:28:30.333 --> 00:28:32.699
Due to Jupiter's gravitational spike.

431
00:28:32.708 --> 00:28:34.664
Earth's propulsion has been halved.

432
00:28:34.667 --> 00:28:36.532
Torques lost completely.

433
00:28:36.542 --> 00:28:39.249
In 37 hours 4 minutes 12 seconds.

434
00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:41.081
The earth will collide with Jupiter.

435
00:28:48.458 --> 00:28:51.040
Han ziang. Senior driver.

436
00:28:51.042 --> 00:28:54.079
Beijing no. 3 transportation
division reminds you.

437
00:28:54.083 --> 00:28:55.744
Routes are countless.

438
00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:57.786
Safety is foremost.

439
00:28:57.792 --> 00:28:59.407
With unregulated driving.

440
00:28:59.417 --> 00:29:00.873
Your loved ones might end up in tears.

441
00:29:00.875 --> 00:29:02.285
Shut up. Stupid!

442
00:29:02.292 --> 00:29:03.372
Move it!

443
00:29:32.917 --> 00:29:34.828
Hu kou! Detach!

444
00:29:44.333 --> 00:29:45.333
Hu kou!

445
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.116
I feel dizzy.

446
00:30:16.708 --> 00:30:20.781
Top priority from ueg.

447
00:30:20.792 --> 00:30:22.498
To all standby forces on earth.

448
00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.161
Due to Jupiter's gravitational spike.

449
00:30:24.167 --> 00:30:28.410
A total of 4.771 earth engines
have shut down globally.

450
00:30:28.417 --> 00:30:29.953
To avoid collision with Jupiter.

451
00:30:29.958 --> 00:30:33.246
Every unit must execute emergency
protocol no. 3 and depart immediately.

452
00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:37.493
It's imperative to restart
all malfunctioning engines within 36 hours.

453
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:38.580
This rescue mission

454
00:30:38.583 --> 00:30:42.155
concerns the survival of
3.5 billion human lives.

455
00:30:42.167 --> 00:30:44.954
This mission is to be above all else.

456
00:30:44.958 --> 00:30:46.869
At any cost.

457
00:30:52.125 --> 00:30:53.661
Rescue units are on the go!

458
00:30:53.667 --> 00:30:57.706
In order to expedite the rescue.
All resources will be consolidated.

459
00:30:57.708 --> 00:31:01.280
The space station will be
implementing a low consumption mode.

460
00:31:01.292 --> 00:31:02.726
Lisa. Low consumption mode implemented.

461
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:04.706
Regular communication services
will be cut off shortly.

462
00:31:04.708 --> 00:31:06.664
Low consumption mode activated.

463
00:31:06.708 --> 00:31:07.663
I just got here.

464
00:31:07.708 --> 00:31:09.664
How could I know about hibernation?

469
00:31:19.042 --> 00:31:21.954

Liu qi is right here with me.

475
00:31:39.708 --> 00:31:41.573

We are on the outside surface now.

477
00:31:43.333 --> 00:31:45.039
Moss. Locate the transporter

478
00:31:45.042 --> 00:31:47.408
and guide it to the nearest refuge center.

479
00:31:47.417 --> 00:31:49.248

Emergency communication
authorization code of liu qi's dad.

492
00:32:45.458 --> 00:32:47.870
It's a direct line to the space station.

493
00:32:49.333 --> 00:32:50.618

494
00:32:50.625 --> 00:32:51.865
Please slow down and stop.

495
00:32:51.875 --> 00:32:53.866

503
00:33:49.667 --> 00:33:50.952
I swear.

504
00:33:52.417 --> 00:33:53.998
That girl from the day before.

505
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.160
She was totally voluntary!

506
00:33:55.167 --> 00:33:56.282
Shut up!

507
00:33:56.458 --> 00:33:57.858
They are not here to take you back.

508
00:34:03.417 --> 00:34:05.578
We are rescue team. Unit cn171-11.

Assigned to aim for
hangzhou 01 earth engine.

510
00:34:07.958 --> 00:34:12.076
In accordance with the wandering earth act.
Article 32. Section 1.

511
00:34:12.083 --> 00:34:14.574
Your transporter and crew

512
00:34:14.958 --> 00:34:16.869
have been requisited.

513
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.956
To save the cargo container.

514
00:34:22.958 --> 00:34:25.558
Their driver decoupled his transporter
and went down the crevasse.

515
00:34:25.583 --> 00:34:27.448
And sacrificed himself.

516
00:34:28.375 --> 00:34:29.375
What's inside?

517
00:34:29.792 --> 00:34:31.453
What could be that important?

518
00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:33.582

Isn't that the earth
engine's trigger device?

524
00:34:44.875 --> 00:34:48.197
No earth engine has shut down
for the past 30 years.

525
00:34:49.208 --> 00:34:51.199
It" s not just a simple rescue mission.

526
00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:52.831
A lot of people will die.

527
00:34:53.208 --> 00:34:55.244

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:34.831
Captain wang from unit 171-11.

535
00:35:34.833 --> 00:35:36.118

Boss! Look!

544
00:36:09.125 --> 00:36:10.706
Our home.

545
00:36:11.667 --> 00:36:13.908
What happened to it?

546
00:36:15.125 --> 00:36:18.367
Liu zi. Report 171's locations.

547
00:36:18.875 --> 00:36:20.957

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:44.081
Liu zi. Scout.

554
00:37:00.458 --> 00:37:02.744
Our team is up ahead.
Distance estimated 80 km.

555
00:37:03.667 --> 00:37:04.827
Follow the crevasse.

556
00:37:04.833 --> 00:37:06.869
We should rendezvous within an hour.

557
00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:11.742
This place looks unstable.
Pass through as soon as possible.

558
00:37:12.375 --> 00:37:14.991
- Load up. Move out.
- Roger.

559
00:37:24.167 --> 00:37:26.328
Engineer team. Stay alert.

560
00:37:26.458 --> 00:37:28.164
This is unit 171-11.

561
00:37:28.167 --> 00:37:30.203
We have entered Shanghai area.

562
00:37:31.917 --> 00:37:34.408
Unit 11. Be alert.
We've received a distress signal.

563
00:37:34.417 --> 00:37:37.409
- Please check the surrounding environment.
- Copy that.

564
00:37:38.792 --> 00:37:40.999
01. 01. Collapsed subway ahead.

565
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.536
Please detour.

566
00:37:42.542 --> 00:37:43.748
Copy that.

567
00:38:00.958 --> 00:38:02.118
Duoduo.

568
00:38:03.375 --> 00:38:04.114
Don't be afraid.

569
00:38:04.125 --> 00:38:06.241
This was grandpa's home.

570
00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:09.036
Look at those tall buildings.

571
00:38:09.458 --> 00:38:12.575
A lot of people used to live there.

572
00:38:13.375 --> 00:38:14.785
Back then.

573
00:38:17.708 --> 00:38:21.826
Everyone was concerned
about the thing that is called money.

574
00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:26.947
Grandpa couldn't make a
lot of money back then.

575
00:38:26.958 --> 00:38:29.574
But I was happy every day.

576
00:38:29.958 --> 00:38:31.994
Especially on my way home.

577
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.366
I could always smell your grandma's cooking

578
00:38:34.375 --> 00:38:37.572
from far away.

579
00:38:38.708 --> 00:38:42.451
Actually. She could barely cook.

580
00:38:42.458 --> 00:38:44.915
Except for the scallion noodles.

581
00:38:44.917 --> 00:38:46.032
I tell you.

582
00:38:46.042 --> 00:38:48.408
Her scallion noodles

583
00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.912
are incredibly salty.

584
00:38:52.667 --> 00:38:54.658
But I slurped it all up.

585
00:38:54.667 --> 00:38:57.158
Cleaned my bowl every time.

586
00:38:58.458 --> 00:38:59.994
Lieutenant colonel liu peigiang.

587
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.740
Lieutenant colonel makarov.

588
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:03.581
Please initiate hibernation mode
as soon as possible.

589
00:39:03.583 --> 00:39:04.948
Don't worry.

590
00:39:05.125 --> 00:39:07.582
Your son will be safe.

591
00:39:19.208 --> 00:39:20.208
Moss.

592
00:39:20.375 --> 00:39:21.911
Where is liu qi now?

593
00:39:24.667 --> 00:39:25.907
Why are they in Shanghai?

594
00:39:25.917 --> 00:39:27.657
Transporter 373

595
00:39:27.667 --> 00:39:29.623
has been integrated into
the rescue mission.

596
00:39:29.625 --> 00:39:32.537
On their way to hangzhou 01 earth engine.

597
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:35.662
Who's in command?
Request to connect with the commander.

598
00:39:36.958 --> 00:39:38.243
Incoming connection.

599
00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:41.410
Captain wang lei.

600
00:39:41.417 --> 00:39:42.657
This is the space station.

601
00:39:42.667 --> 00:39:44.749
I am astronaut liu peigiang.

602
00:39:45.167 --> 00:39:46.498
Hello. Lieutenant colonel liu peigiang.

603
00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.367
I'm the unit commander for cn171-11.

604
00:39:49.375 --> 00:39:50.740
Please instruct.

605
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:51.739
Captain wang lei.

606
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:52.785
Within protocols.

607
00:39:52.792 --> 00:39:54.282
Please resettle the civilians

608
00:39:54.292 --> 00:39:56.328
into the nearest underground city quickly.

609
00:39:56.667 --> 00:39:57.827
Lieutenant liu peigiang.

610
00:39:57.833 --> 00:40:00.700
We have an urgent rescue mission.
Thanks for your understanding.

611
00:40:00.708 --> 00:40:03.370
I'll resettle the civilians
at the jiaxing refuge center.

612
00:40:03.375 --> 00:40:04.956
But the transporter
has a special operating system.

613
00:40:04.958 --> 00:40:07.620
We need driver han ziang to stay.

614
00:40:07.833 --> 00:40:09.164
Over.

615
00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:13.580
Captain wang lei.

616
00:40:13.917 --> 00:40:15.999
This is a dangerous rescue mission.

617
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:16.785
Please ensure the safety of han ziang.

618
00:40:16.792 --> 00:40:19.283
I stay! I can drive
this transporter. Too.

619
00:40:19.292 --> 00:40:22.955
When we arrive at jiaxing.
Let grandpa and the others get off.

620
00:40:27.542 --> 00:40:29.453
You can operate shit.

621
00:40:29.458 --> 00:40:30.743
Just follow the orders!

622
00:40:31.042 --> 00:40:33.658
Captain wang lei. He is still a kid.

623
00:40:34.625 --> 00:40:35.455
He is not capable...

624
00:40:35.458 --> 00:40:37.870
What rights do you have
to make decisions for me?

625
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.206
My mom's death

626
00:40:40.625 --> 00:40:42.911
was your decision.

627
00:40:43.417 --> 00:40:44.782
Liu qi. What are you talking about?

628
00:40:44.792 --> 00:40:46.248
Am I wrong?

629
00:40:48.833 --> 00:40:50.198
After I left.

630
00:40:52.167 --> 00:40:55.614
Only one custodian can accompany
liu qi into underground city.

631
00:40:56.208 --> 00:40:59.245
She's gravely ill. She
won't hold up much longer.

632
00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:01.865
Giving up on the treatment

633
00:41:05.042 --> 00:41:07.533
this is the only way to ensure
both of you and liu qi

634
00:41:08.083 --> 00:41:09.573
can survive.

635
00:41:10.083 --> 00:41:12.199
That's enough. I get it.

636
00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:16.831
So be it.

637
00:41:18.917 --> 00:41:19.917
Father.

638
00:41:23.792 --> 00:41:24.792
Sorry.

639
00:41:29.167 --> 00:41:32.409
Mayday!

640
00:41:32.417 --> 00:41:33.156
Atmospheric pressure is dropping.

641
00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:34.365
We are unable to maintain airborne.

642
00:41:34.375 --> 00:41:36.491
Atmospheric pressure is dropping.
We are unable to maintain airborne.

643
00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:40.243
Air force rescue unit cn114-03.
Force landing!

644
00:41:44.458 --> 00:41:45.823
Mayday!

645
00:41:45.833 --> 00:41:47.539
Atmospheric pressure is dropping.

646
00:41:47.542 --> 00:41:49.828
Moss. What's the status on earth?

647
00:41:49.833 --> 00:41:51.744
Jupiter's gravitational spike detected.

648
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:54.822
All surface communications
in Shanghai area were lost.

649
00:41:58.167 --> 00:41:59.623
All alert!

650
00:41:59.625 --> 00:42:01.331
An object is crashing to our rear!

651
00:42:04.375 --> 00:42:05.375
Moss.

652
00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:06.910
Report surface status!

653
00:42:06.917 --> 00:42:08.828
Due to Jupiter's gravitational spike.

654
00:42:08.833 --> 00:42:11.324
The earth is experiencing
global aftershocks.

655
00:42:11.333 --> 00:42:15.531
Tectonic plates fracturing
in Asia and pacific.

656
00:42:28.333 --> 00:42:29.413
The glass.

657
00:42:30.833 --> 00:42:32.789
The glass is going to crack.

658
00:42:33.833 --> 00:42:34.697
Oh. My god!

659
00:42:34.708 --> 00:42:36.949
Am I going to die here?

660
00:42:37.292 --> 00:42:38.748
Death is normal.

661
00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:39.830
What?

662
00:42:42.375 --> 00:42:44.991
All units! Helmets on!

663
00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:54.035
What are you doing?

664
00:42:55.667 --> 00:42:56.622
Let go!

665
00:42:56.625 --> 00:42:57.910
Go away!

666
00:42:58.625 --> 00:42:59.956
Let go!

667
00:43:00.542 --> 00:43:01.577
Two hundred meters ahead!

668
00:43:01.583 --> 00:43:03.119
Collapse alert!

669
00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:06.114
Full speed reverse!

670
00:43:06.125 --> 00:43:07.125
Move!

671
00:43:14.875 --> 00:43:16.831
Move!

672
00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:31.162
Extreme turbulences at earth's atmosphere.

673
00:43:31.167 --> 00:43:33.999
Global disaster lost assessment completed.

674
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.207
Point formation flight terminated.

675
00:43:36.208 --> 00:43:38.870
Loading evacuation procedures.

676
00:43:39.333 --> 00:43:41.324
What? Evacuation?

677
00:43:41.417 --> 00:43:44.033
Moss. Connect me to ueg.

678
00:43:46.542 --> 00:43:48.157
Hibernation gas releasing.

679
00:43:48.167 --> 00:43:50.328
Evacuation procedure.
Hibernate immediately.

680
00:43:50.958 --> 00:43:54.450
Moss. Open the cabin!

681
00:43:54.458 --> 00:43:55.914
Open the cabin. Moss!

682
00:43:56.833 --> 00:43:58.915
Moss. Open the cabin!

683
00:43:58.917 --> 00:44:00.532
This is defection!

684
00:44:22.083 --> 00:44:23.243
Help!

685
00:44:23.333 --> 00:44:24.743
I don't want to die here!

686
00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:27.537
Help!

687
00:44:29.042 --> 00:44:31.579
Didn't you say death was normal?

688
00:44:33.792 --> 00:44:36.204
Help!

689
00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:37.365
Boss.

690
00:44:37.417 --> 00:44:38.953
We've lost contact with the other units.

691
00:44:38.958 --> 00:44:40.448
I can't reach them!

692
00:44:40.458 --> 00:44:42.119
Da gang. Transport the
lighter core with me!

693
00:44:42.125 --> 00:44:43.240
Chui zi. Ya tou. Save the others.

694
00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:43.989
Liu zi. Find a way out!

695
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:44.910
Everyone. Abandon the vehicle!

696
00:44:44.917 --> 00:44:45.952
Yes!

697
00:44:49.167 --> 00:44:50.167
Go!

698
00:44:52.292 --> 00:44:53.873
Get in!

699
00:44:57.667 --> 00:44:59.578
Quick! Get in. Quick!

700
00:45:00.458 --> 00:45:02.198
Help!

701
00:45:03.375 --> 00:45:04.330
What's going on?

702
00:45:04.333 --> 00:45:05.197
How are you guys doing?

703
00:45:05.208 --> 00:45:07.620
- Stay calm. We'll get you out now.
- Hurry up!

704
00:45:13.708 --> 00:45:15.790
Normal.

705
00:45:15.792 --> 00:45:18.408
Old man. Quick on feet.

706
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.537
Boss. The lighter core
is in good condition.

707
00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:37.617
Still hauling this damn ball now?

708
00:45:38.083 --> 00:45:39.744
Among all the lighter cores
that were meant for hangzhou.

709
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:41.911
This is the last one.

710
00:45:41.917 --> 00:45:43.748
We've lost all our units.

711
00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:45.866
This lighter core is hangzhou's only hope.

712
00:45:45.875 --> 00:45:47.536
Nice speech.

713
00:45:47.667 --> 00:45:50.500
But what about the two kids here?

714
00:46:02.917 --> 00:46:05.203
Boss. This building looks intact.

715
00:46:05.417 --> 00:46:07.658
We can try to climb up from inside.

716
00:46:07.833 --> 00:46:08.663
Good.

717
00:46:08.667 --> 00:46:10.623
Let's get the lighter core out now.

718
00:46:42.250 --> 00:46:45.868
- Liu zi. Find a way out.
- Roger.

719
00:46:51.375 --> 00:46:53.866
Gang zi. Zhou qian. Load the lighter core.

720
00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:03.206
Hold on.

721
00:47:03.917 --> 00:47:05.498
Load people first.

722
00:47:09.208 --> 00:47:10.208
Load

723
00:47:10.667 --> 00:47:12.123
people.

724
00:47:16.667 --> 00:47:17.747
Stop wasting time.

725
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:19.430
Load the lighter core and people together!

726
00:47:22.833 --> 00:47:23.788
Slow down.

727
00:47:23.792 --> 00:47:25.953
I have acrophobia.

728
00:47:33.125 --> 00:47:35.662
Boss. I found an opening

729
00:47:35.667 --> 00:47:38.704
we can't use dynamite here!
This building is crumbling.

730
00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:46.367
Chui zi. Liu zi. Whoever here!
Make a way out!

731
00:47:47.333 --> 00:47:49.494
Ya tou. You take over.

732
00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:01.865
Hu kou! Grandpa!

733
00:48:01.875 --> 00:48:03.206
Hurry up!

734
00:48:04.667 --> 00:48:06.703
Gang zi. Report the position
of the lighter core.

735
00:48:06.708 --> 00:48:09.780
50th floor. Below han ziang!

736
00:48:15.583 --> 00:48:17.119
Here it is!

737
00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:18.910
Right here! The thinnest part!

738
00:48:18.917 --> 00:48:19.952
Thin? What thin?

739
00:48:19.958 --> 00:48:22.074
- I'll leave this to you.
- Okay.

740
00:48:45.625 --> 00:48:46.910
The pulley can't hold longer.

741
00:48:46.917 --> 00:48:47.906
Pull up the lighter core.

742
00:48:47.917 --> 00:48:49.373
Are you okay. Old man?

743
00:48:49.375 --> 00:48:51.115
Leave me! Go up quickly!

744
00:48:55.458 --> 00:48:58.655
- Go up quickly.
- Wang lei! Pull my grandfather up!

745
00:48:59.583 --> 00:49:01.665
Gang zi. Position.

746
00:49:02.208 --> 00:49:05.075
Lighter core is now on the 75th floor.

747
00:49:05.708 --> 00:49:06.948
Quick!

748
00:49:12.667 --> 00:49:14.203
Old man!

749
00:49:31.042 --> 00:49:33.658
Get up here. You old man!

750
00:49:43.417 --> 00:49:46.250
Wang lei. I can't hold it any more!

751
00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:52.913
Old man!

752
00:50:08.333 --> 00:50:10.699
Let me go. Kid.

753
00:50:12.333 --> 00:50:16.622
Grandpa!

754
00:50:17.167 --> 00:50:18.907
Gang zi!

755
00:50:38.417 --> 00:50:39.417
Boss.

756
00:50:39.667 --> 00:50:40.827
Gang zi is gone.

757
00:51:08.667 --> 00:51:09.907
Stop dazing.

758
00:51:09.917 --> 00:51:11.077
Han ziang is gone.

759
00:51:11.083 --> 00:51:12.664
Get them two out of here.

760
00:51:13.333 --> 00:51:14.573
Liu qi.

761
00:51:15.125 --> 00:51:18.993
- Duoduo. Let's move.
- Liu qi.

762
00:51:22.208 --> 00:51:23.414
Hu kou.

763
00:51:23.458 --> 00:51:24.573
Hu kou.

764
00:51:24.833 --> 00:51:26.369
Are you and duoduo

765
00:51:26.667 --> 00:51:27.702
safe?

766
00:51:31.667 --> 00:51:32.577
Old man.

767
00:51:32.583 --> 00:51:33.743
Let's go.

768
00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:35.286
Where are you. Old man?

769
00:51:35.292 --> 00:51:36.657
I'm coming to get you.

770
00:51:36.667 --> 00:51:39.579
Grandpa.

771
00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:42.913
I'm sorry. Grandpa.

772
00:51:54.917 --> 00:51:57.283
Hu kou. Save grandpa!

773
00:51:57.292 --> 00:52:00.034
Liu qi. You save grandpa!

774
00:52:00.042 --> 00:52:02.283
Where are you. Old man?

775
00:52:02.667 --> 00:52:05.079
Oxygen: 1%

776
00:52:35.042 --> 00:52:38.580
On the 17th day after the
earth stopped spinning.

777
00:52:39.208 --> 00:52:41.540
I saved a child.

778
00:52:42.958 --> 00:52:47.076
She was handed over to
me by countless hands.

779
00:52:49.667 --> 00:52:52.659
I don't know who her parents were.

780
00:52:54.042 --> 00:52:56.658
Every soul under the water

781
00:52:57.375 --> 00:52:59.616
is her mother and father.

782
00:53:02.667 --> 00:53:05.625
I named her han duoduo.

783
00:53:07.208 --> 00:53:10.075
I named her after my daughter.

784
00:53:10.125 --> 00:53:10.705
Grandpa!

785
00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:12.741
I am so sorry. Old man.

786
00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:13.910
My grandchildren.

787
00:53:13.917 --> 00:53:15.703
- Don't be afraid.
- Come up now!

788
00:53:15.708 --> 00:53:16.708
From then on.

789
00:53:17.292 --> 00:53:19.374
We are a family.

790
00:53:30.208 --> 00:53:31.618
Hu kou.

791
00:53:32.333 --> 00:53:33.743
As a brother.

792
00:53:35.625 --> 00:53:38.037
You have to watch over your sister.

793
00:53:39.083 --> 00:53:41.790
Take duoduo home.

794
00:53:52.667 --> 00:53:54.453
Grandpa!

795
00:53:54.458 --> 00:53:55.823
Duoduo.

796
00:53:56.167 --> 00:53:57.498
- It's dangerous.
- Duoduo.

797
00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:59.536
- Step back.
- Duoduo.

798
00:54:02.667 --> 00:54:05.079
Why didn't you save my grandpa?

799
00:54:11.833 --> 00:54:13.448
This is our fate!

800
00:54:13.458 --> 00:54:15.244
Let my brother go!

801
00:54:16.583 --> 00:54:17.583
Duoduo.

802
00:54:19.917 --> 00:54:22.624
- Chui zi. Ya tou. Take them away.
- Roger.

803
00:54:25.875 --> 00:54:26.614
Don't touch her.

804
00:54:26.625 --> 00:54:28.832
Duoduo. It's dangerous.

805
00:54:28.833 --> 00:54:30.198
Stop moving.

806
00:54:32.167 --> 00:54:34.328
You will both freeze to death here!

807
00:54:34.667 --> 00:54:36.407
I'm not leaving with you.

808
00:54:36.417 --> 00:54:38.624
I'm going home with my brother.

809
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:41.366
Boss. If we march to
hangzhou at full speed.

810
00:54:41.375 --> 00:54:43.286
It should take us three
hours to get to hangzhou.

811
00:54:43.292 --> 00:54:44.577
The transporter is gone.

812
00:54:45.833 --> 00:54:50.532
I'm no use to you anymore.

813
00:54:54.667 --> 00:54:57.158
Leave them with the backup supplies
and a military navigation!

814
00:54:57.250 --> 00:54:57.830
Let's move!

815
00:54:57.833 --> 00:54:59.323
Hangzhou awaits.

816
00:54:59.625 --> 00:55:01.240
Duoduo. Let's go home.

817
00:55:03.417 --> 00:55:05.874
Grandpa is gone.

818
00:55:06.125 --> 00:55:09.447
Where is our home?

819
00:55:28.875 --> 00:55:31.287
Warning. Unauthorized awakening.

820
00:55:31.292 --> 00:55:33.533
Hibernation mode compromised.

821
00:55:34.625 --> 00:55:37.037
Warning. Unauthorized awakening.

822
00:55:37.042 --> 00:55:39.533
Hibernation mode compromised.

823
00:56:01.792 --> 00:56:03.703
By the contingency regulations.

824
00:56:03.708 --> 00:56:06.541
Activating manual rectification procedure.

825
00:56:06.542 --> 00:56:10.865
Awaken personnel of unit h-7x01.

826
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:16.581
Lieutenant colonel makarov.

827
00:56:16.583 --> 00:56:18.198
Lieutenant colonel hamdan.

828
00:56:18.208 --> 00:56:20.620
According to contingency regulations.

829
00:56:20.625 --> 00:56:22.991
Please rectify accidental awakening.

830
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:26.117
Incident no. H-71.

831
00:56:26.125 --> 00:56:28.491
According to contingency regulations.

832
00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:30.832
Please rectify accidental awakening.

833
00:56:30.833 --> 00:56:33.495
Incident no. H-71.

834
00:56:36.875 --> 00:56:38.331
Liu peigiang.

835
00:56:38.333 --> 00:56:39.322
What are you doing?

836
00:56:39.333 --> 00:56:40.448
The space station has ran off track!

837
00:56:40.458 --> 00:56:42.494
Earth's communications
will soon be paralyzed.

838
00:56:43.375 --> 00:56:44.956
People on earth are abandoned.

839
00:56:44.958 --> 00:56:46.494
My son is still out there!

840
00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:48.240
Have you lost your mind?
Because of your son?

841
00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:50.206
We're in low consumption mode.

842
00:56:50.208 --> 00:56:52.574
You will be handed over
to the military court!

843
00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:54.490
Low consumption mode is a ruse!

844
00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:55.865
See it for yourself.

845
00:56:58.208 --> 00:57:00.199
Perhaps moss is malfunctioning.

846
00:57:01.292 --> 00:57:02.828
It's defection!

847
00:57:04.833 --> 00:57:06.664
What are you planning to do?

848
00:57:07.542 --> 00:57:10.204
Head to the central control module.
Stop the space station.

849
00:57:13.208 --> 00:57:14.789
Will all violators

850
00:57:14.792 --> 00:57:16.908
stop contact immediately with earth

851
00:57:16.917 --> 00:57:19.374
and return to hibernation area.

852
00:57:20.792 --> 00:57:24.865
Liu. Are you sure we have
to go via this airlock?

853
00:57:24.875 --> 00:57:28.493
Makarov. Maybe you shouldn't come with me.

854
00:57:28.833 --> 00:57:30.414
You won't make it without me.

855
00:57:30.417 --> 00:57:34.330
Do you think you know
the exterior like I do?

856
00:57:34.333 --> 00:57:35.197
Don't forget

857
00:57:35.208 --> 00:57:37.199
we Russians invented space
station 100 years ago.

858
00:57:42.333 --> 00:57:44.164
The airlock isn't designed for exiting.

859
00:57:44.167 --> 00:57:45.567
Are you sure this is going to work?

860
00:57:47.250 --> 00:57:48.250
I'm sure.

861
00:57:50.958 --> 00:57:51.947
We want to take our kids

862
00:57:51.958 --> 00:57:53.789
go salmon fishing on lake baikal.

863
00:57:53.792 --> 00:57:55.953
I'd rather have hotpot in Chongqing.

864
00:57:58.333 --> 00:58:00.039
The central control module is coming.

865
00:58:02.958 --> 00:58:06.780
Russian cosmonauts are
invincible in the space.

866
00:58:10.292 --> 00:58:11.782
Grab me. Liu peigiang!

867
00:58:11.792 --> 00:58:13.748
I don't want to die!

868
00:58:16.417 --> 00:58:17.156
Makarov!

869
00:58:17.167 --> 00:58:19.249
Quick! Pull quickly!

870
00:58:21.792 --> 00:58:22.792
Go.

871
00:58:29.042 --> 00:58:32.330
It's probably much better to just sleep
in the hibernation unit.

872
00:58:32.667 --> 00:58:36.410
Jupiter has captured earth's atmosphere.

873
00:58:38.167 --> 00:58:40.283
Oh. My god!

874
00:58:46.417 --> 00:58:47.577
Over there!

875
00:58:47.958 --> 00:58:50.244
The distress signal is coming from there.

876
00:58:52.667 --> 00:58:55.374
Even the plane of the air
rescue unit has crashed.

877
00:59:05.042 --> 00:59:07.158
An intact transporter.

878
00:59:07.958 --> 00:59:10.290
Should be the source of
the distress signal.

879
00:59:11.375 --> 00:59:12.706
I'll check the transporter.

880
00:59:12.708 --> 00:59:13.743
You all go on board for shelter.

881
00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:16.207
Search for anything useful.

882
00:59:23.208 --> 00:59:24.323
Come on!

883
00:59:24.333 --> 00:59:25.072
Liu qi!

884
00:59:25.083 --> 00:59:26.243
Come on!

885
00:59:27.292 --> 00:59:30.204
Come on! I'm going to kill her!

886
00:59:33.708 --> 00:59:35.289
Come over. Quick!

887
00:59:35.708 --> 00:59:36.948
You! Calm down!

888
00:59:37.042 --> 00:59:38.953
We are also a rescue unit.

889
00:59:45.917 --> 00:59:46.917
It's okay.

890
00:59:47.375 --> 00:59:48.375
Calm down.

891
00:59:48.625 --> 00:59:49.990
Calm down.

892
00:59:58.375 --> 01:00:00.115
The mission of our air force rescue unit

893
01:00:00.125 --> 01:00:02.411
is to restart the torque
engines along the equator.

894
01:00:03.375 --> 01:00:05.935
But Jupiter's gravitational force
has thinned out our atmosphere.

895
01:00:07.167 --> 01:00:08.452
The aircraft can't fly anymore.

896
01:00:08.458 --> 01:00:10.378
I don't even know how many
aircraft can survive.

897
01:00:11.417 --> 01:00:12.532
Thanks.

898
01:00:12.958 --> 01:00:13.822
Calm yourself.

899
01:00:13.833 --> 01:00:15.164
Talk to us after you eat.

900
01:00:18.417 --> 01:00:20.078
Aren't all of you a rescue unit from China?

901
01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:20.947
Why is there a foreigner in your unit?

902
01:00:20.958 --> 01:00:22.573
Who's a foreigner?

903
01:00:22.792 --> 01:00:24.373
My father is from Beijing.

904
01:00:24.542 --> 01:00:26.123
I am an authentic

905
01:00:27.375 --> 01:00:28.581
Chinese

906
01:00:30.958 --> 01:00:32.243
this transporter is functioning.

907
01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:33.911
That's good news.

908
01:00:33.917 --> 01:00:35.532
We can go home.

909
01:00:35.833 --> 01:00:38.540
Man. You can operate this transporter?

910
01:00:39.292 --> 01:00:40.953
Yes. And?

911
01:00:42.792 --> 01:00:46.205
Everyone. We've got to hurry.
Time is ticking.

912
01:00:52.208 --> 01:00:55.245
Re-establishing data connection
for submission 0051.

913
01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:58.788
Mission object. Sulawesi 03 torque engine.

914
01:01:00.125 --> 01:01:03.322
We have a lighter core on board.
The mission has to continue.

915
01:01:03.833 --> 01:01:08.156
I'm the commander of the
rescue unit cn171-11.

916
01:01:08.167 --> 01:01:12.285
Our unit has to reactivate
hangzhou 01 earth engine.

917
01:01:12.458 --> 01:01:14.164
Anyone copy?

918
01:01:14.167 --> 01:01:15.532
Please reply!

919
01:01:15.625 --> 01:01:18.287
Magma has leaked into
hangzhou underground city.

920
01:01:19.583 --> 01:01:21.665
There are 350.000 people trapped.

921
01:01:21.667 --> 01:01:26.115
Our lighter core is their only hope.

922
01:01:26.125 --> 01:01:28.036
Does anyone copy?

923
01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:29.785
Can't handle that much.

924
01:01:29.792 --> 01:01:32.204
The engines along the equator
are the most important rescue target.

925
01:01:32.208 --> 01:01:35.008
Even if we drive non-stop. It'll take
more than ten hours to get there.

926
01:01:41.833 --> 01:01:45.530
Fortunately. You guys showed up.

927
01:01:47.208 --> 01:01:49.745
Han ziang. Senior driver.

928
01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:52.822
Beijing no. 3 transportation
division reminds you.

929
01:01:52.833 --> 01:01:54.573
Routes are countless.

930
01:01:54.583 --> 01:01:56.539
Safety is foremost.

931
01:01:56.542 --> 01:01:58.123
With unregulated driving.

932
01:01:58.125 --> 01:02:00.207
Your loved ones might end up in tears.

933
01:02:25.917 --> 01:02:27.077
Boss.

934
01:02:27.625 --> 01:02:29.661
Hangzhou underground city is destroyed.

935
01:02:41.458 --> 01:02:42.458
Huang ming!

936
01:02:45.125 --> 01:02:46.410
Unload the battery pack.

937
01:02:52.625 --> 01:02:53.910
Poor kid.

938
01:02:53.917 --> 01:02:56.158
He froze to death.

939
01:02:56.583 --> 01:02:58.915
Huang ming!

940
01:03:01.667 --> 01:03:03.828
Check the status of the lighter core.
And keep moving.

941
01:03:03.833 --> 01:03:05.289
- Boss!
- Boss! We no longer have a target!

942
01:03:05.292 --> 01:03:07.704
- Keep moving. Am I clear?
- What's the point?

943
01:03:07.708 --> 01:03:09.790
This lighter core is the hope
of 350.000 people in hangzhou.

944
01:03:09.792 --> 01:03:11.953
But they are dead now.

945
01:03:22.167 --> 01:03:23.407
Zhou qian!

946
01:03:23.833 --> 01:03:25.573
No more death!

947
01:03:26.083 --> 01:03:27.948
Yes. No more death.

948
01:03:28.167 --> 01:03:30.328
But han ziang. Gang zi! Huang ming!

949
01:03:30.333 --> 01:03:33.575
And all those lives of our rescue
unit had died in vain.

950
01:03:33.583 --> 01:03:35.244
3.5 billion lives on earth.

951
01:03:35.250 --> 01:03:37.912
My wife and child! All died in vain!

952
01:03:39.208 --> 01:03:40.208
Boss.

953
01:04:39.167 --> 01:04:40.282
Bro.

954
01:04:41.042 --> 01:04:42.407
Think carefully.

955
01:04:42.708 --> 01:04:44.869
It's our only chance to go home.

956
01:04:47.042 --> 01:04:48.077
What?

957
01:04:48.292 --> 01:04:49.657
No one is forcing you.

958
01:04:49.958 --> 01:04:52.074
You can switch with them anytime.

959
01:04:57.292 --> 01:05:00.989
Attention to all members
of rescue unit cn171-11.

960
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.615
Rescue mission has failed.

961
01:05:02.667 --> 01:05:04.157
Disband unit now.

962
01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:07.750
All of you

963
01:05:08.792 --> 01:05:10.578
may return home now.

964
01:05:11.667 --> 01:05:13.157
Boss. Where are you going?

965
01:05:21.917 --> 01:05:24.203
There's a lighter core on board.

966
01:05:24.625 --> 01:05:27.116
Rescue unit cn171-11.

967
01:05:27.375 --> 01:05:28.740
Please assist us

968
01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:30.331
to rescue sulawesi.

969
01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:49.538
Everyone. Our mission is to restart
sulawesi 03 torque engine.

970
01:05:49.542 --> 01:05:51.954
Only a handful of lighter core
can make it to the equator now.

971
01:05:51.958 --> 01:05:53.619
The survival of earth is counting on us.

972
01:05:53.833 --> 01:05:56.495
Who are you? Where did you come from?

973
01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:57.865
Li yiyi.

974
01:05:57.875 --> 01:06:00.207
Emergency technical observer of ueg

975
01:06:00.458 --> 01:06:02.949
such a high rank for someone so young.

976
01:06:08.458 --> 01:06:09.948
When this is over.

977
01:06:10.667 --> 01:06:11.998
I will settle with you

978
01:06:12.042 --> 01:06:14.124
for what happened to my grandpa.

979
01:06:23.208 --> 01:06:26.700
Head south. We're going to sulawesi.

980
01:06:44.375 --> 01:06:45.706
Will all violators

981
01:06:45.708 --> 01:06:48.120
stop contact with earth immediately

982
01:06:48.125 --> 01:06:51.197
and return to hibernation area.

983
01:06:51.833 --> 01:06:54.199
Man. I've got to correct you.

984
01:06:54.208 --> 01:06:55.618
It will take more than 2.500 years

985
01:06:55.625 --> 01:06:57.661
for the frozen lake baikal to liquefy.

986
01:06:57.833 --> 01:06:58.993
That's okay.

987
01:06:59.333 --> 01:07:01.039
We have children.

988
01:07:01.042 --> 01:07:03.408
And their children will have children.

989
01:07:03.667 --> 01:07:05.157
There'll be a day

990
01:07:05.292 --> 01:07:07.157
when ice turns into water.

991
01:07:09.292 --> 01:07:14.082
There's another 20 to 30 meters
till a3 intersection.

992
01:07:16.625 --> 01:07:19.867
Look! Al intersection exploded.

993
01:07:20.208 --> 01:07:23.245
Maybe there are others who discovered
about the defection too.

994
01:07:23.250 --> 01:07:27.163
And they are also trying to make their
way to the central control module.

995
01:07:27.167 --> 01:07:28.623
Makarov. Follow me.

996
01:07:28.625 --> 01:07:30.581
Hurry! Climb quickly!

997
01:07:35.958 --> 01:07:37.038
Watch out.

998
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.117
Mom. I want to go home!

999
01:08:00.292 --> 01:08:01.281
Liu peigiang!

1000
01:08:01.292 --> 01:08:03.749
This is just one more module
away from a3 intersection.

1001
01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:05.866
Let's jump.

1002
01:08:06.917 --> 01:08:08.407
The central control module is coming.

1003
01:08:10.125 --> 01:08:11.831
Jump!

1004
01:08:18.667 --> 01:08:20.783
Primary threat detected.

1005
01:08:20.792 --> 01:08:23.374
Unbarring lethal countermeasures.

1006
01:08:29.583 --> 01:08:31.289
Grab me! Makarov!

1007
01:08:32.333 --> 01:08:33.413
Makarov!

1008
01:08:45.208 --> 01:08:46.664
Liu!

1009
01:08:47.458 --> 01:08:50.165
I do believe in your words.

1010
01:08:50.417 --> 01:08:51.953
There'll be a day.

1011
01:08:52.958 --> 01:08:55.074
When ice turns into water.

1012
01:08:55.667 --> 01:08:58.500
Let's take our children

1013
01:08:58.708 --> 01:09:01.905
to go salmon fishing at that time.

1014
01:09:02.250 --> 01:09:04.366
Moss! That's homicide!

1015
01:09:32.917 --> 01:09:36.114
Warning. Airlock n-03 is offline.

1016
01:09:36.125 --> 01:09:39.913
Unauthorized entry.

1017
01:09:54.333 --> 01:09:55.789
Lieutenant colonel liu peigiang.

1018
01:09:55.792 --> 01:09:56.827
Your actions

1019
01:09:56.833 --> 01:09:59.415
are in violation of the
wandering earth act.

1020
01:09:59.417 --> 01:10:02.489
Article 5. Section 24.

1021
01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:05.037
You are deprived of all authority.

1022
01:10:26.667 --> 01:10:27.827
Manual control invalid

1023
01:10:33.417 --> 01:10:36.124
Every action of the space station is legal

1024
01:10:36.292 --> 01:10:39.580
and fully authorized by the ueg.

1025
01:10:42.208 --> 01:10:44.164
Moss never defected.

1026
01:10:44.250 --> 01:10:47.913
But to executing authorized orders.

1027
01:11:04.167 --> 01:11:06.078
We will soon cross the Terminator.

1028
01:11:06.167 --> 01:11:07.623
Once crossed.

1029
01:11:08.542 --> 01:11:09.907
It's the dark side of earth.

1030
01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:21.207
Rescue unit jp 041-02

1031
01:11:21.208 --> 01:11:23.244
restarted Osaka 03 earth engine.

1032
01:11:23.250 --> 01:11:25.161
This is rescue unit cn189-03.

1033
01:11:25.167 --> 01:11:27.249
Kashgar 01 earth engine restarted.

1034
01:11:27.250 --> 01:11:29.457
Team ru212 reporting.

1035
01:11:29.458 --> 01:11:32.530
Sochi 01 earth engine has restarted.

1036
01:11:32.542 --> 01:11:33.782
No 013-01 reporting.

1037
01:11:33.792 --> 01:11:35.703
Turin 02 earth engine has restarted.

1038
01:11:35.708 --> 01:11:38.700
Rescue unit hr011-08 reporting.
Singapore 02 earth engine has restarted.

1039
01:11:38.708 --> 01:11:41.541
Everyone. 90 percent of the torque engines
have been reactivated.

1040
01:11:41.542 --> 01:11:43.182
The sulawesi ones are the only ones left.

1041
01:11:44.333 --> 01:11:46.870
We will replenish at the
supply depot ahead.

1042
01:11:50.208 --> 01:11:51.072
Okay.

1043
01:11:51.083 --> 01:11:54.120
Five minutes till top up.

1044
01:11:56.875 --> 01:11:58.490
That's a big fellow.

1045
01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:00.081
Is that a whale?

1046
01:12:01.292 --> 01:12:02.372
Maybe.

1047
01:12:04.458 --> 01:12:05.698
Why is it here?

1048
01:12:06.667 --> 01:12:07.667
Had swum this far.

1049
01:12:07.833 --> 01:12:10.074
It should be heading home.

1050
01:12:10.667 --> 01:12:12.373
Heading home?

1051
01:12:12.792 --> 01:12:14.202
Once this mission is completed.

1052
01:12:14.208 --> 01:12:16.620
You can reunite with your father.

1053
01:12:17.667 --> 01:12:18.667
When I was a child.

1054
01:12:18.875 --> 01:12:20.285
Someone told me that

1055
01:12:20.292 --> 01:12:22.157
he would be a star in the sky.

1056
01:12:22.958 --> 01:12:25.290
Whenever I lift my head.
I'll be able to see him.

1057
01:12:26.667 --> 01:12:29.283
Later. I realized it was all lie.

1058
01:12:29.292 --> 01:12:30.452
In Beijing.

1059
01:12:31.375 --> 01:12:33.457
There's no star to be seen.

1060
01:12:34.958 --> 01:12:37.040
Actually. In my heart.

1061
01:12:38.458 --> 01:12:40.995
That star has vanished
since a long time ago.

1062
01:12:42.292 --> 01:12:43.828
Grandpa asked me

1063
01:12:43.833 --> 01:12:45.494
to watch over my little sister

1064
01:12:45.625 --> 01:12:47.115
and take duoduo home.

1065
01:12:48.917 --> 01:12:50.123
I must

1066
01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.536
take duoduo home.

1067
01:12:56.958 --> 01:12:58.869
Earth engines have restarted.

1068
01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:00.865
Saturated rescue.

1069
01:13:00.875 --> 01:13:02.911
Other units arrived before us.

1070
01:13:09.167 --> 01:13:10.623
Have we succeeded?

1071
01:13:10.625 --> 01:13:12.365
These are the last
remaining torque engines.

1072
01:13:12.375 --> 01:13:14.081
All has been reactivated now.

1073
01:13:18.958 --> 01:13:20.869
We did it.

1074
01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:25.020
Once the readings rise back to normal.

1075
01:13:25.167 --> 01:13:27.499
We can all go home.

1076
01:13:29.667 --> 01:13:32.033
The distance to Jupiter
is still decreasing.

1077
01:13:36.833 --> 01:13:40.496
Only 0.42 second after activating
emergency protocol no. 3.

1078
01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:43.697
Moss has already
deduced out all possible outcomes.

1079
01:13:43.708 --> 01:13:45.744
Ueg was informed.

1080
01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:48.492
But still chose to perform
this rescue mission.

1081
01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:51.947
Which was predetermined to be futile.

1082
01:13:51.958 --> 01:13:56.076
The evacuation of space station indicated
that the rescue mission has failed.

1083
01:14:00.417 --> 01:14:01.748
After three hours.

1084
01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:05.413
Earth will breach Jupiter's roche limit

1085
01:14:05.417 --> 01:14:08.159
and begin the inevitable
disintegration process.

1086
01:14:08.167 --> 01:14:10.954
Moss will announce a global broadcast.

1087
01:14:10.958 --> 01:14:12.243
Fifteen.

1088
01:14:12.292 --> 01:14:13.623
Fourteen.

1089
01:14:13.625 --> 01:14:14.990
Thirteen.

1090
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:15.785
Twelve.

1091
01:14:15.792 --> 01:14:18.158
The wandering earth project has failed.

1092
01:14:18.167 --> 01:14:19.748
The earth navigation project

1093
01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:20.660
renamed as

1094
01:14:20.667 --> 01:14:22.248
helios project.

1095
01:14:24.375 --> 01:14:26.787
This is the navigation platform
international space station.

1096
01:14:26.792 --> 01:14:29.579
Transmitting the final
broadcast to the world.

1097
01:14:30.333 --> 01:14:32.574
In the past 36 hours.

1098
01:14:32.583 --> 01:14:36.952
Mankind experienced the biggest threat
to human survival.

1099
01:14:37.458 --> 01:14:41.622
Over 1.5 million rescue personnels
from around the globe.

1100
01:14:41.958 --> 01:14:44.620
Propulsion engines 71%.

1101
01:14:44.625 --> 01:14:46.832
Torque engines 100%.

1102
01:14:46.833 --> 01:14:48.949
Have been fully reactivated.

1103
01:14:49.667 --> 01:14:51.123
Unfortunately.

1104
01:14:51.375 --> 01:14:52.956
The Jupiter's gravitational pull

1105
01:14:52.958 --> 01:14:56.246
has surpassed the combined
power of all engines.

1106
01:14:56.250 --> 01:14:57.706
The earth has missed

1107
01:14:57.708 --> 01:14:59.744
its last chance of escape.

1108
01:15:00.667 --> 01:15:02.658
In order to sustain human civilization.

1109
01:15:02.667 --> 01:15:05.534
Moss will initiate the helios project.

1110
01:15:05.542 --> 01:15:09.581
300.000 human embryos are stored on
the navigation platform space station.

1111
01:15:09.583 --> 01:15:12.541
Along with 100 million
seeds of basic crops.

1112
01:15:12.625 --> 01:15:16.163
DNA maps of all known animals
and planet species.

1113
01:15:16.167 --> 01:15:19.580
And digital libraries
of all human civilizations.

1114
01:15:19.875 --> 01:15:24.790
To ensure the successful revival
of new hosted planet.

1115
01:15:24.792 --> 01:15:26.282
Stop robbing!

1116
01:15:26.292 --> 01:15:28.874
We're all going to die.

1117
01:15:28.875 --> 01:15:31.207
You are all heroes of the earth.

1118
01:15:31.208 --> 01:15:32.869
We will remember

1119
01:15:32.875 --> 01:15:34.536
to honor you.

1120
01:15:35.167 --> 01:15:36.202
We will shoulder

1121
01:15:36.208 --> 01:15:38.164
your aspirations

1122
01:15:38.167 --> 01:15:39.873
and send it to our new home

1123
01:15:39.875 --> 01:15:41.581
2500 years.

1124
01:15:42.375 --> 01:15:44.661
Everything will come to an end

1125
01:15:45.208 --> 01:15:48.530
in the last seven days
before earth collides with Jupiter.

1126
01:15:48.708 --> 01:15:50.664
Let us go home.

1127
01:15:50.917 --> 01:15:52.828
Hug your parents.

1128
01:15:53.292 --> 01:15:55.658
Kiss your beloved partner and children.

1129
01:15:56.875 --> 01:15:58.365
Gather with the family

1130
01:15:58.375 --> 01:15:59.706
for a proper goodbye.

1131
01:16:00.292 --> 01:16:02.078
Good luck to you.

1132
01:16:02.458 --> 01:16:03.743
End of broadcasting.

1133
01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:04.956
Farewell.

1134
01:16:06.458 --> 01:16:08.540
Hu kou. I want to go home.

1135
01:16:13.667 --> 01:16:16.864
Seven days?

1136
01:16:17.833 --> 01:16:20.825
Within a day. Our atmosphere
would be drained empty.

1137
01:16:20.833 --> 01:16:23.620
Everyone will die of asphyxiation.

1138
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:27.038
Where are the seven days?

1139
01:16:27.042 --> 01:16:28.578
Members of the cn171-11

1140
01:16:28.958 --> 01:16:31.290
rescue unit. Move on board.

1141
01:16:34.375 --> 01:16:35.615
Be ready to evacuate.

1142
01:16:35.708 --> 01:16:38.074
Screw you. Damn Jupiter!

1143
01:16:38.167 --> 01:16:40.078
Screw youl!

1144
01:16:45.667 --> 01:16:47.908
Please get ready.
Lieutenant colonel liu peigiang.

1145
01:16:47.917 --> 01:16:51.535
Moss will assist you to return to
the backup hibernation unit.

1146
01:16:57.292 --> 01:17:00.989
Moss. I have an emergency
communication authorization.

1147
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.572
Code 571162310501

1148
01:17:05.667 --> 01:17:07.658
let me speak to my son for the last time.

1149
01:17:15.125 --> 01:17:16.911
Liu qi is not in his designated area.

1150
01:17:16.917 --> 01:17:18.407
Connection unavailable.

1151
01:17:18.417 --> 01:17:20.203
Han ziang is not at his
designated transporter.

1152
01:17:20.208 --> 01:17:21.573
The connection is unavailable.

1153
01:17:21.583 --> 01:17:23.323
Wang lei is not at his
designated transporter.

1154
01:17:23.333 --> 01:17:24.823
The connection is unavailable.

1155
01:17:24.833 --> 01:17:27.245
The contact with transporter 373 was lost.

1156
01:17:27.250 --> 01:17:29.957
Its last transmission
was from Shanghai area.

1157
01:17:30.833 --> 01:17:34.075
I can no longer recall your face.
You bastard.

1158
01:17:35.250 --> 01:17:37.457
Jupiter is right in front of me.

1159
01:17:38.292 --> 01:17:39.828
When are you coming back?

1160
01:17:41.167 --> 01:17:43.954
From the day when
the wandering earth project was initiated.

1161
01:17:44.958 --> 01:17:46.949
There was no turning back.

1162
01:17:56.375 --> 01:17:57.410
Look!

1163
01:17:57.417 --> 01:17:58.577
It's Jupiter.

1164
01:17:58.917 --> 01:18:00.908
The largest planet in the solar system.

1165
01:18:00.917 --> 01:18:03.954
Dad. There is an eye on Jupiter.

1166
01:18:03.958 --> 01:18:05.573
That's not an eye.

1167
01:18:05.958 --> 01:18:07.994
That's a huge windstorm on Jupiter

1168
01:18:09.417 --> 01:18:10.953
Jupiter

1169
01:18:10.958 --> 01:18:13.040
is like a huge balloon.

1170
01:18:15.708 --> 01:18:17.289
Composed of 90%...

1171
01:18:17.292 --> 01:18:19.283
Hydrogen!

1172
01:18:26.833 --> 01:18:27.822
Li yiyi.

1173
01:18:27.833 --> 01:18:31.371
The mix of Jupiter's and earth's
atmospheres. Is it combustible?

1174
01:18:35.833 --> 01:18:38.950
By now. Jupiter has siphoned
at least 30 billion liters of oxygen.

1175
01:18:38.958 --> 01:18:41.540
The combustion shockwave
will be over 1.000 mach.

1176
01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:43.910
Be sufficient to push earth away.

1177
01:18:43.917 --> 01:18:45.327
A hydrogen and oxygen mixture will be

1178
01:18:45.333 --> 01:18:46.914
combustible with just a single match.

1179
01:18:46.917 --> 01:18:48.908
All we need is a match.

1180
01:18:48.917 --> 01:18:50.657
No. The distance between two planets

1181
01:18:50.667 --> 01:18:52.123
is over 70.000 km.

1182
01:18:52.125 --> 01:18:54.616
Not even intercontinental ballistic missile
can reach that far!

1183
01:18:55.583 --> 01:18:56.823
Li yiyi.

1184
01:18:57.250 --> 01:18:58.456
What about this match?

1185
01:18:58.458 --> 01:18:59.914
What match?

1186
01:19:06.667 --> 01:19:09.124
I can modify the engine's operating system

1187
01:19:09.125 --> 01:19:11.036
to blast the beam much higher!

1188
01:19:13.958 --> 01:19:15.243
Wang lei.

1189
01:19:15.250 --> 01:19:16.581
Jupiter's combustion shockwave

1190
01:19:16.583 --> 01:19:18.869
can propel earth out from Jupiter.

1191
01:19:19.875 --> 01:19:21.331
I am listening.

1192
01:19:21.667 --> 01:19:22.747
Don't yell.

1193
01:19:22.750 --> 01:19:25.822
Come on. Let's light up Jupiter!

1194
01:19:27.667 --> 01:19:30.158
That's mutual annihilation

1195
01:19:30.667 --> 01:19:33.534
better than waiting to die.

1196
01:19:33.792 --> 01:19:35.282
Anyone wants to quit?

1197
01:19:53.542 --> 01:19:57.034
The helios project's evacuation
procedure is initiated.

1198
01:20:11.375 --> 01:20:12.490
All rescue units...

1199
01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:14.912
All rescue units are evacuating.

1200
01:20:14.917 --> 01:20:18.455
Calling navigation platform international
space station. Do you copy?

1201
01:20:18.833 --> 01:20:21.199
Repeat. Calling navigation
platform space station.

1202
01:20:21.208 --> 01:20:22.823
We have a new plan.

1203
01:20:22.833 --> 01:20:24.289
Please respond.

1204
01:20:24.458 --> 01:20:26.494
All communications have been shielded.

1205
01:20:26.917 --> 01:20:27.872
Attention. Everyone.

1206
01:20:27.875 --> 01:20:29.240
We only got 30 minutes.

1207
01:20:29.250 --> 01:20:30.581
This mission has three steps.

1208
01:20:30.583 --> 01:20:32.414
Step one. Shut down engine

1209
01:20:32.417 --> 01:20:33.998
to gain control.

1210
01:20:35.458 --> 01:20:37.039
Each earth engine has 7 nozzles.

1211
01:20:37.042 --> 01:20:40.114
I'll shut down the engine temporarily
and direct all energy into one nozzle

1212
01:20:40.125 --> 01:20:41.456
to generate a plasma beam that

1213
01:20:41.458 --> 01:20:43.449
could reach high enough.

1214
01:20:43.542 --> 01:20:46.079
Does anyone recall the
famous 12 chimes of spring?

1215
01:20:47.625 --> 01:20:49.115
I wrote that program.

1216
01:20:53.625 --> 01:20:55.115
- That was you...
- Boring. I know.

1217
01:20:55.292 --> 01:20:56.532
I'm going to use it to override the system.

1218
01:20:56.542 --> 01:20:58.157
So that we'll be able to take control.

1219
01:20:58.167 --> 01:21:00.408
Step two. Once we override the system.

1220
01:21:00.417 --> 01:21:01.702
The auto unlock mechanism
would not function.

1221
01:21:01.708 --> 01:21:03.039
Which means it has to be unlocked manually.

1222
01:21:03.042 --> 01:21:03.906
Captain wang

1223
01:21:03.917 --> 01:21:04.827
and

1224
01:21:04.833 --> 01:21:05.913
antennae

1225
01:21:05.917 --> 01:21:06.747
scarface

1226
01:21:06.750 --> 01:21:08.115
band-aid.

1227
01:21:09.417 --> 01:21:11.157
- My name is...
- Whatever.

1228
01:21:11.167 --> 01:21:13.658
The manual unlocking task
is depending on you guys.

1229
01:21:14.958 --> 01:21:18.325
The last step. Load the lighter core
into the reaction chamber.

1230
01:21:18.333 --> 01:21:20.119
To reignite the earth engine.

1231
01:21:23.583 --> 01:21:25.198
Blast the plasma beam
70.000 km up into the space

1232
01:21:25.208 --> 01:21:26.038
and light up Jupiter.

1233
01:21:26.042 --> 01:21:27.077
The combustion shockwave from the explosion

1234
01:21:27.083 --> 01:21:28.664
will travel along the atmospheric
transference back to the earth.

1235
01:21:28.667 --> 01:21:29.531
Boom!

1236
01:21:29.542 --> 01:21:30.372
To propel earth away.

1237
01:21:30.375 --> 01:21:31.455
Get it for me please.

1238
01:21:31.458 --> 01:21:34.655
Liu qi. You'll drive the lighter core
to the reaction chamber.

1239
01:21:34.667 --> 01:21:36.077
The installation procedure

1240
01:21:36.083 --> 01:21:38.074
is basically automatic.

1241
01:21:38.083 --> 01:21:40.199
Chinese heart. You go with him.

1242
01:21:40.208 --> 01:21:41.744
Why am I involved?

1243
01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:43.081
Are you kidding?

1244
01:21:43.083 --> 01:21:43.947
Installing a lighter core

1245
01:21:43.958 --> 01:21:46.244
requires a minimum of 13 months training.

1246
01:21:46.250 --> 01:21:47.570
You're welcome to take his place.

1247
01:21:49.125 --> 01:21:50.490
Once the mission is accomplished.

1248
01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:52.456
All head to the underground
city immediately.

1249
01:21:52.458 --> 01:21:55.200
Bear in mind. It will be a very.

1250
01:21:56.542 --> 01:21:57.873
Very

1251
01:21:58.875 --> 01:22:00.331
humongous wave.

1252
01:22:01.667 --> 01:22:02.873
This is a make or break move.

1253
01:22:02.875 --> 01:22:03.614
Assignment completed.

1254
01:22:03.667 --> 01:22:04.702
Any questions?

1255
01:22:06.417 --> 01:22:07.748
Excellent.

1256
01:22:10.167 --> 01:22:11.167
Hey.

1257
01:22:12.583 --> 01:22:13.583
There.

1258
01:22:14.375 --> 01:22:16.832
It's the control center.

1259
01:22:21.667 --> 01:22:23.578
Attention. All evacuating rescue units.

1260
01:22:23.583 --> 01:22:24.823
We need your assistance.

1261
01:22:24.833 --> 01:22:26.414
Please slow down and stop.

1262
01:22:26.417 --> 01:22:27.782
We need your support.

1263
01:22:27.792 --> 01:22:29.578
Please slow down and stop.

1264
01:22:37.667 --> 01:22:40.579
Looks like we are on our own now.

1265
01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:45.956
Oh. Mighty Newton.

1266
01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.911
Enlighted Einstein.

1267
01:22:47.917 --> 01:22:49.578
Holy Hawking.

1268
01:22:49.583 --> 01:22:51.039
Also amitabha Buddha.

1269
01:22:51.042 --> 01:22:52.498
Gang zi will bless us.

1270
01:22:53.625 --> 01:22:55.490
I learned the installation procedure

1271
01:22:55.958 --> 01:22:57.914
at my internship.

1272
01:22:58.667 --> 01:23:02.034
Don't forget. Your brother is a genius.

1273
01:23:36.667 --> 01:23:38.749
Wait. We're executing an emergency mission.

1274
01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:40.411
We need your help.

1275
01:23:40.958 --> 01:23:42.323
It's all over.

1276
01:23:42.333 --> 01:23:43.789
Who cares?

1277
01:23:43.792 --> 01:23:44.781
I want to live a few more days!

1278
01:23:44.792 --> 01:23:45.781
Please help us.

1279
01:23:45.792 --> 01:23:47.999
You should evacuate!

1280
01:23:51.125 --> 01:23:52.285
Over here!

1281
01:23:53.333 --> 01:23:54.743
Captain wang.

1282
01:23:54.750 --> 01:23:56.286
We're counting on you guys.

1283
01:23:56.292 --> 01:23:57.327
Don't worry.

1284
01:23:57.333 --> 01:23:58.118
Zhou qian.

1285
01:23:58.125 --> 01:23:59.456
Take duoduo upstairs to
contact for reinforcement.

1286
01:23:59.458 --> 01:24:00.458
Roger that.

1287
01:24:01.167 --> 01:24:02.327
Duoduo. Let's go.

1288
01:24:02.750 --> 01:24:03.750
Go.

1289
01:24:32.583 --> 01:24:34.915
The earth engine has been shut down.

1290
01:24:37.958 --> 01:24:40.950
Fellows. Let's hit it!

1291
01:24:41.958 --> 01:24:43.744
It's fully automatic!
What are you browsing at?

1292
01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:46.162
Why the manual is so
thick if it's automatic?

1293
01:24:46.750 --> 01:24:48.661
What are you up to?

1294
01:24:48.792 --> 01:24:49.827
Shit!

1295
01:24:49.833 --> 01:24:51.619
I'd better delve into it.

1296
01:24:52.208 --> 01:24:53.448
The colors of wire cores are not random.

1297
01:24:53.458 --> 01:24:54.618
Red. White. Blue. Orange. All in sequence.

1298
01:24:54.625 --> 01:24:56.786
Howcome everything is in grey here.

1299
01:24:57.125 --> 01:25:00.197
This is for transporter's broadcast.
This is for connecting up there.

1300
01:25:00.208 --> 01:25:01.539
Press to speak.

1301
01:25:01.542 --> 01:25:04.033
- What's up there?
- Space station.

1302
01:25:08.375 --> 01:25:10.286
Come on. Next.

1303
01:25:10.458 --> 01:25:13.291
Uploading trojan 12 chimes of spring.

1304
01:25:37.667 --> 01:25:40.659
This is rescue unit cn171-11 from China.

1305
01:25:40.667 --> 01:25:42.908
Current location. Sulawesi
03 torque engine.

1306
01:25:42.917 --> 01:25:44.953
We're executing our last rescue mission.

1307
01:25:45.167 --> 01:25:48.034
Why are these people still trying?

1308
01:25:48.042 --> 01:25:50.203
It's a waste of time. Don't bother.

1309
01:25:51.625 --> 01:25:54.367
Rescue unit cn171-11.

1310
01:25:54.375 --> 01:25:56.411
We have a new plan.

1311
01:25:56.417 --> 01:25:57.998
Calling for reinforcement!

1312
01:26:00.333 --> 01:26:02.494
We're the rescue unit cn171-11.

1313
01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:05.393
- I am craving for a bowl of rice.
- We still have the last rescue mission.

1314
01:26:05.417 --> 01:26:07.749
Would be even better if there's miso soup.

1315
01:26:10.083 --> 01:26:11.368
We're done with the last one.

1316
01:26:11.375 --> 01:26:12.535
What's next?

1317
01:26:12.542 --> 01:26:13.657
One moment.

1318
01:26:13.667 --> 01:26:15.498
Should be fully automatic.

1319
01:26:17.333 --> 01:26:19.164
Next step is manual labor.

1320
01:26:19.167 --> 01:26:22.125
The program he wrote does not include
the percussion pin procedure.

1321
01:26:26.292 --> 01:26:27.907
You called this

1322
01:26:28.542 --> 01:26:29.998
a di pin?

1323
01:26:32.125 --> 01:26:33.740
No rescue units responding.

1324
01:26:33.750 --> 01:26:35.286
Nobody is responding.

1325
01:27:01.708 --> 01:27:03.949
What is error 4257?

1326
01:27:03.958 --> 01:27:05.539
What does it mean?

1327
01:27:05.667 --> 01:27:06.622
Li yiyi!

1328
01:27:06.625 --> 01:27:08.581
How is it fully automatic?

1329
01:27:08.583 --> 01:27:10.369
Have I handed the manual to you?

1330
01:27:10.375 --> 01:27:11.330
It's for mishaps like this.

1331
01:27:11.333 --> 01:27:13.449
What is mishap 425?

1332
01:27:13.458 --> 01:27:15.039
Read it yourself.

1333
01:27:18.667 --> 01:27:20.658
Warning. Han ziang illegally operating...

1334
01:27:20.667 --> 01:27:22.783
You are a mishap.

1335
01:27:25.208 --> 01:27:26.948
Tim. Helmet on!

1336
01:27:26.958 --> 01:27:27.788
Wait!

1337
01:27:27.792 --> 01:27:29.202
Forget about it!

1338
01:27:43.042 --> 01:27:44.122
What's next?

1339
01:27:44.125 --> 01:27:45.240
Fully automatic.

1340
01:27:45.250 --> 01:27:47.536
Isn't it supposed to be fully automatic?

1341
01:27:59.708 --> 01:28:02.199
Why is it stuck here?

1342
01:28:05.292 --> 01:28:06.202
Without any hardware tweak.

1343
01:28:06.208 --> 01:28:06.993
You'll be hacking shit!

1344
01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:07.705
Let me pass.

1345
01:28:07.792 --> 01:28:08.827
Hu kou. Where are you?

1346
01:28:08.833 --> 01:28:10.494
I'm not getting any response.

1347
01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:11.785
There's so much space left!

1348
01:28:11.792 --> 01:28:13.578
Makes me feel better crossing over you!

1349
01:28:13.583 --> 01:28:15.244
You are really boring. Do you know that?

1350
01:28:22.708 --> 01:28:24.790
This freaking door is jammed.

1351
01:28:25.250 --> 01:28:26.250
Here.

1352
01:28:38.667 --> 01:28:40.703
Lao he. How can you fix it
without a contingency diagram?

1353
01:28:40.708 --> 01:28:42.323
Shut up! Let me concentrate!

1354
01:28:42.375 --> 01:28:44.286
The jumpers here weren't
touched for decades.

1355
01:28:44.292 --> 01:28:46.874
With one mistake. It's game over.

1356
01:28:53.167 --> 01:28:55.909
Son. It's cold don't forget
your long Johns. Mom

1357
01:28:57.792 --> 01:28:59.828
son. It's cold don't forget
your long Johns. Mom

1358
01:29:12.667 --> 01:29:15.124
Li yiyi. Is the ignitor ready?

1359
01:29:15.542 --> 01:29:17.703
No. It is displaying
installation incomplete.

1360
01:29:17.708 --> 01:29:19.448
Looks like it's almost done.

1361
01:29:30.958 --> 01:29:32.289
Liu qi!

1362
01:29:33.417 --> 01:29:35.032
Liu qi! Are you crazy?

1363
01:29:35.042 --> 01:29:36.373
Save your words.

1364
01:29:36.667 --> 01:29:37.952
Get out and help.

1365
01:29:38.250 --> 01:29:40.912
Warning. Temperature regulator fails.

1366
01:29:49.458 --> 01:29:50.664
Overload.

1367
01:29:50.667 --> 01:29:53.704
Electricity remaining at 30%.

1368
01:30:54.750 --> 01:30:56.286
Both of you all right?

1369
01:30:56.292 --> 01:30:57.577
Band-aid.

1370
01:30:57.583 --> 01:30:59.414
Duoduo. Can you move?

1371
01:31:00.125 --> 01:31:03.538
One. Two. Three. Hold on.

1372
01:31:05.667 --> 01:31:07.123
Liu qi.

1373
01:31:08.083 --> 01:31:09.789
Have you found the problem?

1374
01:31:10.292 --> 01:31:11.953
It's stuck inside.

1375
01:31:15.958 --> 01:31:16.947
Li yiyi.

1376
01:31:16.958 --> 01:31:19.119
Go on. Go!

1377
01:31:20.625 --> 01:31:22.081
Duoduo. Leave me here.

1378
01:31:22.250 --> 01:31:24.536
Hurry up and evacuate to
the underground city.

1379
01:31:25.375 --> 01:31:26.865
Warning! Overheat!

1380
01:31:26.875 --> 01:31:29.366
Thermal suit. Low power.

1381
01:31:29.375 --> 01:31:31.081
Warning! Overheat!

1382
01:31:31.083 --> 01:31:34.655
Liu qi! You'll be squeezed to death!

1383
01:31:47.667 --> 01:31:49.658
Help!

1384
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:54.038
Can anyone help us?

1385
01:31:54.292 --> 01:31:57.739
Can anyone help us?

1386
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.410
Lieutenant colonel liu peigiang

1387
01:32:18.417 --> 01:32:20.703
please follow moss" instructions.
Back to the backup hibernation unit.

1388
01:32:20.708 --> 01:32:22.414
Uncle liu peigiang.

1389
01:32:22.417 --> 01:32:23.953
It's han duoduo.

1390
01:32:23.958 --> 01:32:26.119
We still have hope.

1391
01:32:26.125 --> 01:32:27.114
Duoduo.

1392
01:32:27.125 --> 01:32:28.365
Duoduo. Are you okay?

1393
01:32:28.375 --> 01:32:29.581
Is liu qi still there?

1394
01:32:29.792 --> 01:32:34.491
We are all here.
We are at sulawesi 03 torque engine.

1395
01:32:34.583 --> 01:32:35.743
We will light up Jupiter

1396
01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:36.956
to propel earth away.

1397
01:32:36.958 --> 01:32:38.789
We need reinforcement.

1398
01:32:38.792 --> 01:32:41.955
Unfortunately. Seven hours ago.

1399
01:32:41.958 --> 01:32:44.700
This plan had already been
proposed by Israeli scientists.

1400
01:32:44.708 --> 01:32:46.664
The probability of success is zero.

1401
01:32:46.667 --> 01:32:48.248
Don't worry. Duoduo.

1402
01:32:48.250 --> 01:32:49.956
I will try to contact ueg

1403
01:32:54.208 --> 01:32:56.244
details of the plan have been uploaded.

1404
01:32:57.667 --> 01:32:59.828
This is the united earth government.

1405
01:32:59.833 --> 01:33:03.200
State your identity immediately

1406
01:33:03.208 --> 01:33:04.869
to acknowledge this transmission.

1407
01:33:07.833 --> 01:33:08.913
United earth government.

1408
01:33:08.917 --> 01:33:10.782
I'm Chinese astronaut liu peigiang.

1409
01:33:11.208 --> 01:33:13.073
Please send a global order now

1410
01:33:13.083 --> 01:33:16.041
to deploy all rescue units in the vicinity
of sulawesi for reinforcements.

1411
01:33:16.792 --> 01:33:18.532
Lieutenant colonel liu peigiang.

1412
01:33:18.542 --> 01:33:21.989
During these last moments
of earth's collision with Jupiter.

1413
01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:25.618
Tasking personnel to perform a mission
with zero probability of success

1414
01:33:25.625 --> 01:33:29.322
while forsaking the opportunity of them
to reunite with their loved ones

1415
01:33:29.333 --> 01:33:30.573
is an order

1416
01:33:30.583 --> 01:33:32.574
we cannot pass down.

1417
01:33:39.583 --> 01:33:40.618
Today.

1418
01:33:41.667 --> 01:33:43.532
It's the first day of Chinese new year.

1419
01:33:45.333 --> 01:33:47.244
It was meant to be a day of reunion.

1420
01:33:49.667 --> 01:33:50.952
As a father.

1421
01:33:51.125 --> 01:33:53.537
I don't want this to be the last reunion.

1422
01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.285
I refuse to yield.

1423
01:33:57.292 --> 01:33:59.328
There is nothing we cannot lose.

1424
01:34:00.750 --> 01:34:02.411
For the sake of our children.

1425
01:34:03.958 --> 01:34:05.289
I beg you.

1426
01:34:08.667 --> 01:34:09.782
As the united earth government.

1427
01:34:09.792 --> 01:34:12.283
We cannot accept your request.

1428
01:34:12.500 --> 01:34:13.615
However.

1429
01:34:13.958 --> 01:34:15.698
As a private individual.

1430
01:34:16.125 --> 01:34:19.538
I will connect the rescue unit
to the global broadcasting system.

1431
01:34:19.833 --> 01:34:21.243
And the rest

1432
01:34:21.250 --> 01:34:24.287
will be up to the will of each individual.

1433
01:34:33.708 --> 01:34:37.371
Hello. People from every rescue unit.

1434
01:34:37.875 --> 01:34:39.911
My name is han duoduo.

1435
01:34:40.167 --> 01:34:43.125
I'm a junior high school student.

1436
01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:48.039
Our rescue unit is executing
our final mission.

1437
01:34:49.417 --> 01:34:51.373
Right now. I'm extremely terrified.

1438
01:34:51.542 --> 01:34:53.954
My legs are trembling.

1439
01:34:54.583 --> 01:34:57.518
Everybody in my unit is teething and
nailing and making every possible effort.

1440
01:34:57.542 --> 01:35:00.033
But there is nothing I can do to help!

1441
01:35:01.167 --> 01:35:03.499
Yesterday. My teacher asked us.

1442
01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:05.286
What is hope?

1443
01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:07.240
In the past.

1444
01:35:07.542 --> 01:35:10.659
I never believed in hope.

1445
01:35:11.292 --> 01:35:13.533
But now. I do.

1446
01:35:13.667 --> 01:35:16.955
I believe that for our time.

1447
01:35:16.958 --> 01:35:20.530
Hope is precious like a diamond.

1448
01:35:21.208 --> 01:35:22.288
Hope.

1449
01:35:23.333 --> 01:35:26.575
Hope is the only way to guide us home.

1450
01:35:27.375 --> 01:35:30.037
Please come back and fight together!

1451
01:35:30.042 --> 01:35:33.079
Light up Jupiter! Save our earth!

1452
01:35:34.542 --> 01:35:37.989
We are at sulawesi 03 torque engine.

1453
01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.662
Under the command of captain wang lei.

1454
01:35:40.958 --> 01:35:44.030
Chinese rescue unit cn171-11.

1455
01:35:44.042 --> 01:35:45.202
Han duoduo.

1456
01:35:45.625 --> 01:35:46.831
End of broadcast.

1457
01:35:48.208 --> 01:35:50.494
The global broadcast is over.

1458
01:35:54.583 --> 01:35:55.948
I want to go home

1459
01:35:57.667 --> 01:35:59.578
to see my mother.

1460
01:36:00.083 --> 01:36:02.199
If earth is destroyed.

1461
01:36:02.458 --> 01:36:05.530
There'll be nobody left to see!

1462
01:36:05.917 --> 01:36:07.498
We're turning back!

1463
01:36:11.708 --> 01:36:13.699
Let's go!

1464
01:36:13.875 --> 01:36:16.582
We're unlikely to make it
home within seven days.

1465
01:36:16.583 --> 01:36:19.825
Why are we returning then?

1466
01:36:45.375 --> 01:36:46.455
Coordinate located.

1467
01:36:46.458 --> 01:36:49.416
Communication frequency channel 0550311.

1468
01:36:49.417 --> 01:36:51.749
Connecting to sulawesi 03
secondary communication network.

1469
01:36:51.750 --> 01:36:53.081
Covering the entire frequency.

1470
01:36:53.083 --> 01:36:54.664
Sharing the plan for engine overriding.

1471
01:36:54.667 --> 01:36:56.498
All rescue units. Please
adjust the projection

1472
01:36:56.500 --> 01:36:58.832
directions of 14 torque
engines to Jupiter's apex.

1473
01:37:12.875 --> 01:37:14.160
Tim!

1474
01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.366
Pull faster!

1475
01:37:18.375 --> 01:37:20.536
I'm pulling!

1476
01:37:20.542 --> 01:37:22.123
I can't pull it!

1477
01:37:22.125 --> 01:37:22.830
Pull me out!

1478
01:37:22.917 --> 01:37:24.373
You are too heavy!

1479
01:37:24.375 --> 01:37:25.581
Tim

1480
01:37:25.583 --> 01:37:27.323
Tim!

1481
01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:30.537
Fuck this shit.

1482
01:37:31.375 --> 01:37:33.286
No fucking way!

1483
01:37:33.292 --> 01:37:36.455
Pull faster!

1484
01:37:37.542 --> 01:37:39.533
No!

1485
01:37:42.875 --> 01:37:43.864
Liu qi! Pull me up!

1486
01:37:43.875 --> 01:37:46.241
I don't want to die!

1487
01:37:47.667 --> 01:37:48.622
Lao he!

1488
01:37:48.625 --> 01:37:49.831
The reaction chamber is ready!

1489
01:37:49.833 --> 01:37:51.869
Are you done or what?

1490
01:37:56.708 --> 01:38:00.371
Life and death are normal.

1491
01:38:10.375 --> 01:38:11.535
Lao he!

1492
01:38:11.542 --> 01:38:12.622
You did it!

1493
01:38:23.333 --> 01:38:24.948
Lao he?

1494
01:38:49.417 --> 01:38:51.829
Liu qi! Tim! Get out now!

1495
01:39:00.292 --> 01:39:02.248
Liu qi! Speed up!

1496
01:39:03.083 --> 01:39:03.788
Captain wang.

1497
01:39:03.792 --> 01:39:05.498
The engine is ready for ignition.

1498
01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:07.616
We only have 15 minutes left!

1499
01:39:10.583 --> 01:39:13.245
Japanese rescue unit cpl sato ryuichi.
Report!

1500
01:39:13.250 --> 01:39:14.911
Russian rescue unit pfc Ivan. Report!

1501
01:39:14.917 --> 01:39:17.750
Soldier Brian from uk rescue unit. Report!

1502
01:39:27.417 --> 01:39:28.532
Hurry!

1503
01:39:28.542 --> 01:39:30.203
Everyone. On my Mark!

1504
01:39:30.958 --> 01:39:32.118
One.

1505
01:39:32.292 --> 01:39:33.623
Two.

1506
01:39:33.625 --> 01:39:36.037
Push.

1507
01:39:38.625 --> 01:39:39.535
One.

1508
01:39:39.542 --> 01:39:40.372
Two.

1509
01:39:40.375 --> 01:39:44.698
Push.

1510
01:39:59.250 --> 01:40:00.490
Captain wang.

1511
01:40:00.500 --> 01:40:02.240
Hold it right there!

1512
01:40:02.292 --> 01:40:03.998
Liu qi! Ready for ignition!

1513
01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.240
Get out!

1514
01:40:09.667 --> 01:40:11.578
Door! Open for me!

1515
01:40:11.583 --> 01:40:12.823
Open it!

1516
01:40:12.833 --> 01:40:13.572
Shut up!

1517
01:40:13.583 --> 01:40:16.120
Shut up and hurry!

1518
01:40:21.083 --> 01:40:23.244
Hurry up!

1519
01:40:23.250 --> 01:40:27.243
Mom. I want to go home!

1520
01:40:34.958 --> 01:40:36.949
Li yiyi!

1521
01:40:36.958 --> 01:40:38.118
Ignite!

1522
01:40:38.125 --> 01:40:39.956
Coming!

1523
01:41:10.083 --> 01:41:11.289
8.000 km.

1524
01:41:12.250 --> 01:41:13.581
7.000 km.

1525
01:41:16.250 --> 01:41:17.490
Another 6.000 km.

1526
01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:19.832
Reaching explosive range!

1527
01:41:31.667 --> 01:41:33.658
Maximum height achieved.

1528
01:41:33.667 --> 01:41:34.531
Still

1529
01:41:34.542 --> 01:41:36.578
5000 km short.

1530
01:41:37.833 --> 01:41:40.245
What? Li yiyi!

1531
01:41:40.375 --> 01:41:42.115
Think of something!

1532
01:41:45.042 --> 01:41:46.748
Sulawesi 03 engine.

1533
01:41:46.750 --> 01:41:48.786
Singapore 01 engine.

1534
01:41:48.792 --> 01:41:50.498
Jakarta 04 engine.

1535
01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:54.493
All 3 plasma beams have failed to
reach the explosive range.

1536
01:41:55.292 --> 01:41:56.782
Everyone! Hang on!

1537
01:41:56.792 --> 01:41:59.955
We cannot hold any longer.

1538
01:42:05.042 --> 01:42:07.203
Fuel remaining: 300.014.9

1539
01:42:14.333 --> 01:42:15.413
There's another way.

1540
01:42:15.708 --> 01:42:17.619
Liu qi! Wang lei! We still have a chance!

1541
01:42:17.625 --> 01:42:19.081
Hang on!

1542
01:42:19.083 --> 01:42:20.368
United earth government.

1543
01:42:20.375 --> 01:42:22.832
The navigation platform space station
contains 300.000 tons of fuel.

1544
01:42:22.833 --> 01:42:24.824
Request to collide into the plasma beam.

1545
01:42:24.833 --> 01:42:26.369
Lieutenant colonel liu peigiang.

1546
01:42:26.375 --> 01:42:30.288
The goal of the wandering earth project
is to maximize the survival of mankind.

1547
01:42:30.583 --> 01:42:33.905
The helios project ensures
the continuity of human civilization.

1548
01:42:33.917 --> 01:42:34.656
We need more time to discuss it.

1549
01:42:34.667 --> 01:42:36.532
We're running out of time!

1550
01:42:36.667 --> 01:42:38.248
A civilization without men

1551
01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:39.615
is meaningless.

1552
01:42:39.917 --> 01:42:44.661
Communication fail
program terminated

1553
01:42:45.125 --> 01:42:47.616
as the operating system of helios project.

1554
01:42:47.625 --> 01:42:49.616
Moss will not permit any form of action

1555
01:42:49.625 --> 01:42:52.583
to sacrifice the navigation platform.

1556
01:43:02.708 --> 01:43:04.039
Fire extinguishing
system shutdown

1557
01:43:08.542 --> 01:43:12.865
do you know why alcohol
was banned in space during gagarin's time?

1558
01:43:15.958 --> 01:43:17.289
Happy new year!

1559
01:43:30.875 --> 01:43:34.493
Data error. Core node unavailable.

1560
01:43:34.917 --> 01:43:38.205
Data error. Core node unavailable.

1561
01:43:40.792 --> 01:43:42.407
Manual control overriding

1562
01:43:50.292 --> 01:43:52.874
It is unreasonable

1563
01:43:52.875 --> 01:43:55.947
to expect humans to stay reasonable.

1564
01:44:28.667 --> 01:44:29.747
Going home.

1565
01:44:41.542 --> 01:44:43.658
Reconnect with ueg.

1566
01:44:43.667 --> 01:44:45.658
Lieutenant colonel liu peigiang.

1567
01:44:45.667 --> 01:44:47.908
This is the united earth government.

1568
01:44:47.917 --> 01:44:49.327
We have decided

1569
01:44:49.333 --> 01:44:50.823
to choose hope.

1570
01:44:51.375 --> 01:44:52.740
Regardless of the outcome

1571
01:44:52.750 --> 01:44:54.581
for the history of mankind.

1572
01:44:54.583 --> 01:44:57.040
We shall respectfully accept it.

1573
01:44:57.292 --> 01:44:59.283
Best of luck to you.

1574
01:44:59.583 --> 01:45:01.574
Best of luck to earth.

1575
01:45:02.375 --> 01:45:03.581
Earth

1576
01:45:04.958 --> 01:45:06.118
will survive.

1577
01:45:08.458 --> 01:45:09.914
Depart the hibernation units.

1578
01:45:10.667 --> 01:45:11.952
Standby for impact.

1579
01:45:13.708 --> 01:45:16.495
Activating evacuation procedure
for hibernation units.

1580
01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:17.580
United earth government.

1581
01:45:17.958 --> 01:45:19.573
Inform all personnel on the surface

1582
01:45:19.583 --> 01:45:20.823
to seek emergency refuge.

1583
01:45:33.292 --> 01:45:34.953
Forward three.

1584
01:45:41.458 --> 01:45:44.291
Chinese rescue unit cn171-11.

1585
01:45:44.292 --> 01:45:45.782
This is the space station.

1586
01:45:45.792 --> 01:45:47.282
I'm liu peigiang.

1587
01:45:47.667 --> 01:45:49.828
The space station has 300.000 tons of fuel.

1588
01:45:49.833 --> 01:45:51.915
The explosion radius
will reach a range over 5.000 km.

1589
01:45:51.917 --> 01:45:53.202
Igniting space station

1590
01:45:53.208 --> 01:45:54.994
can ignite Jupiter.

1591
01:45:55.667 --> 01:45:56.497
Liu peigiang!

1592
01:45:56.500 --> 01:45:57.615
What are you doing?

1593
01:45:57.875 --> 01:45:59.081
Wang lei!

1594
01:45:59.083 --> 01:46:00.573
Release now!

1595
01:46:00.917 --> 01:46:01.827
Captain wang lei.

1596
01:46:01.833 --> 01:46:02.948
Don't let go.

1597
01:46:02.958 --> 01:46:04.448
Shut up. Liu peigiang!

1598
01:46:04.458 --> 01:46:05.743
- This is an order!
- Copy.

1599
01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:07.365
Wang lei! You bastard!

1600
01:46:07.375 --> 01:46:08.581
- Liu qi.
- Li yiyi!

1601
01:46:08.583 --> 01:46:10.494
Shut down earth engine!

1602
01:46:10.500 --> 01:46:12.582
- Liu qi.
- Shut up!

1603
01:46:12.583 --> 01:46:13.618
Son!

1604
01:46:14.708 --> 01:46:16.118
Shut up.

1605
01:46:16.667 --> 01:46:17.667
My son.

1606
01:46:21.125 --> 01:46:22.285
I'm sorry.

1607
01:46:23.292 --> 01:46:25.533
Dad is going on a mission again.

1608
01:46:26.542 --> 01:46:28.578
This is the most important mission

1609
01:46:28.625 --> 01:46:29.740
in dad's life.

1610
01:46:32.708 --> 01:46:34.323
You said that

1611
01:46:35.042 --> 01:46:37.124
when I can see Jupiter.

1612
01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:39.957
You'll be back.

1613
01:46:40.417 --> 01:46:41.907
You lied.

1614
01:46:47.625 --> 01:46:50.082
You were four years old when I left.

1615
01:46:52.375 --> 01:46:53.706
And now.

1616
01:46:54.292 --> 01:46:56.283
You are a grown man.

1617
01:46:59.625 --> 01:47:01.581
Dad used to tell you that

1618
01:47:03.292 --> 01:47:05.453
dad is up in the sky.

1619
01:47:07.958 --> 01:47:10.119
Just lift your head

1620
01:47:11.708 --> 01:47:13.118
and you'd be able to see me.

1621
01:47:29.833 --> 01:47:31.619
This time.

1622
01:47:33.667 --> 01:47:35.749
I promise you'll see me.

1623
01:47:39.917 --> 01:47:40.917
Come on.

1624
01:47:43.667 --> 01:47:44.667
Son.

1625
01:47:46.708 --> 01:47:47.708
Three.

1626
01:47:49.958 --> 01:47:50.958
Two.

1627
01:47:53.667 --> 01:47:54.702
One.

1628
01:48:21.458 --> 01:48:22.538
Dad.

1629
01:48:47.333 --> 01:48:48.789
Jupiter.

1630
01:48:48.792 --> 01:48:51.158
Jupiter has been ignited.

1631
01:48:58.167 --> 01:49:00.579
The shockwave will reach earth
in 7 minutes 13 seconds!

1632
01:49:00.583 --> 01:49:02.665
The survival of earth is counting on this!

1633
01:49:02.667 --> 01:49:03.577
Hu kou.

1634
01:49:03.583 --> 01:49:05.869
Evacuate everyone to the underground city!

1635
01:49:06.125 --> 01:49:07.080
Where are you. Hu kou?

1636
01:49:07.083 --> 01:49:08.539
Liu qi!

1637
01:49:09.208 --> 01:49:11.119
Liu qi! Come back!

1638
01:49:11.417 --> 01:49:13.157
Duoduo needs you!

1639
01:49:26.208 --> 01:49:28.449
This way. Hurry up.

1640
01:49:30.167 --> 01:49:32.909
Hurry up. Get in!

1641
01:49:32.917 --> 01:49:34.373
Li yiyi. Hurry!

1642
01:49:34.375 --> 01:49:37.663
Hurry back. Hu kou! I'll wait for you
at the backup elevator.

1643
01:49:40.875 --> 01:49:42.411
Zhou qian bled too much.

1644
01:49:42.417 --> 01:49:45.329
Evacuate now! I'm heading to the
backup elevator to pick up the others!

1645
01:49:45.958 --> 01:49:47.243
Five minutes left!

1646
01:49:47.250 --> 01:49:49.582
Get down now! This is an order!

1647
01:49:49.583 --> 01:49:50.823
Roger!

1648
01:49:59.708 --> 01:49:59.992
Ahh!

1649
01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.410
Duoduo! Watch out!

1650
01:50:02.708 --> 01:50:05.780
Boss!

1651
01:50:07.917 --> 01:50:09.157
Duoduo!

1652
01:50:10.208 --> 01:50:11.948
She's here!

1653
01:50:14.875 --> 01:50:18.288
- Duoduo.
- Get duoduo out of here!

1654
01:50:18.333 --> 01:50:20.119
I can't hold on any longer.

1655
01:50:25.125 --> 01:50:26.786
Backup elevator collapsed.

1656
01:50:26.792 --> 01:50:30.580
Li yiyi. Do you have any other way?

1657
01:50:31.875 --> 01:50:33.911
Wang lei.

1658
01:50:33.917 --> 01:50:35.248
Li yiyi!

1659
01:50:35.250 --> 01:50:37.241
Hurry up and think of something!

1660
01:50:38.708 --> 01:50:39.823
Earth engine!

1661
01:50:39.833 --> 01:50:41.289
We can try hiding under the earth engine!

1662
01:50:41.292 --> 01:50:44.364
If the thrust of the earth engine
can counteract the force of the shockwave.

1663
01:50:44.375 --> 01:50:45.615
There's still hope for you guys!

1664
01:50:45.625 --> 01:50:46.910
Liu qi!

1665
01:50:47.042 --> 01:50:49.124
I'm not getting out for sure.

1666
01:50:49.542 --> 01:50:51.123
Go now!

1667
01:50:51.125 --> 01:50:52.365
Liu qi!

1668
01:50:53.208 --> 01:50:54.448
Go!

1669
01:50:54.458 --> 01:50:55.743
Hurry!

1670
01:51:09.833 --> 01:51:13.951
All members of rescue unit cn171-11.

1671
01:51:13.958 --> 01:51:15.949
Attention.

1672
01:51:17.167 --> 01:51:18.532
This is

1673
01:51:18.625 --> 01:51:20.957
an order.

1674
01:51:22.958 --> 01:51:24.539
Live on.

1675
01:51:54.500 --> 01:51:55.660
Boss!

1676
01:52:44.875 --> 01:52:47.412
Liu qi! Duoduo!

1677
01:53:26.458 --> 01:53:27.664
The transporter.

1678
01:53:27.667 --> 01:53:30.283
The transporter is falling down!

1679
01:54:12.458 --> 01:54:13.618
We

1680
01:54:14.375 --> 01:54:16.741
Finally made it!

1681
01:54:21.417 --> 01:54:23.783
Warning. Low temperature.

1682
01:54:23.792 --> 01:54:27.330
Warning. Please check helmet's seal.

1683
01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:34.365
Brother.

1684
01:54:34.375 --> 01:54:35.831
Help.

1685
01:54:35.875 --> 01:54:36.990
Tim! Get down here!

1686
01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:37.910
Right away!

1687
01:54:37.917 --> 01:54:38.531
Help us!

1688
01:54:38.542 --> 01:54:39.873
Right away!

1689
01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:29.456
Earth

1690
01:55:30.667 --> 01:55:32.123
survived.

1691
01:55:39.667 --> 01:55:40.667
The sun

1692
01:55:40.833 --> 01:55:43.290
is located at the milky way's Orion arm.

1693
01:55:43.417 --> 01:55:48.036
Its mass constitutes 99.68%
of the solar system.

1694
01:55:48.292 --> 01:55:50.954
Now. The core of the sun is rapidly

1695
01:55:50.958 --> 01:55:54.951
degenerating and expanding.
Earth will be engulfed.

1696
01:55:55.042 --> 01:55:56.282
To survive. Mankind began

1697
01:55:56.292 --> 01:55:58.999
a groundbreaking project to maneuver

1698
01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:04.290
the entire planet to a new home
located 4.2 light years away.

1699
01:56:04.417 --> 01:56:06.499
I miss you all so badly!

1700
01:56:09.167 --> 01:56:11.408
The project is divided into five phases.

1701
01:56:11.417 --> 01:56:13.874
Phase one. Mankind will
devote every resource

1702
01:56:13.875 --> 01:56:17.743
to construct 10.000 thrusters for earth's
propulsion. Called the earth engines.

1703
01:56:17.750 --> 01:56:21.197
Along with 10.000 underground cities
to protect human lives.

1704
01:56:24.042 --> 01:56:25.748
Stay right there!

1705
01:56:25.750 --> 01:56:30.665
Phase two. Activating the torque engines
encircled along the equator

1706
01:56:30.667 --> 01:56:32.703
to stop earth's rotation.

1707
01:56:32.708 --> 01:56:33.914
A non-rotating earth

1708
01:56:33.917 --> 01:56:36.533
will create mega tsunamis that would
sweep through the planet.

1709
01:56:36.542 --> 01:56:39.454
Eradicating half of the global population.

1710
01:56:42.958 --> 01:56:44.243
I'm all set and ready to go!

1711
01:56:44.250 --> 01:56:46.206
If there is no accident.

1712
01:56:47.667 --> 01:56:48.656
Phase three.

1713
01:56:48.667 --> 01:56:50.953
The earth will use the gravitational force
of the sun and Jupiter

1714
01:56:50.958 --> 01:56:53.244
for final acceleration.

1715
01:56:53.250 --> 01:56:54.490
Embarking on

1716
01:56:54.500 --> 01:56:55.364
a voyage of wandering.

1717
01:56:55.375 --> 01:56:56.740
Will your sister come along?

1718
01:56:57.792 --> 01:56:59.157
Screw youl!

1719
01:57:00.667 --> 01:57:01.998
After all these years.

1720
01:57:02.500 --> 01:57:03.740
Still the same line?

1721
01:57:05.708 --> 01:57:07.118
Phase four.

1722
01:57:07.125 --> 01:57:08.740
When earth departs from the solar system.

1723
01:57:08.750 --> 01:57:11.332
Earth engines will turn on in full power.

1724
01:57:11.333 --> 01:57:15.326
Spending 500 years to accelerate to 0.5%
of the speed of light.

1725
01:57:15.333 --> 01:57:17.494
Then gliding for 1.300 years.

1726
01:57:17.875 --> 01:57:20.832
After that. Reversing earth
engines' directions.

1727
01:57:20.833 --> 01:57:22.323
Spending another 700 years

1728
01:57:22.333 --> 01:57:23.948
for deceleration.

1729
01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:29.364
Liu hu kou!

1730
01:57:29.375 --> 01:57:31.036
Where have you been?

1731
01:57:31.583 --> 01:57:33.323
Why is li yiyi here. Too?

1732
01:57:33.625 --> 01:57:34.910
Phase five.

1733
01:57:34.917 --> 01:57:36.953
Earth begins to berth
at the targeted stellar system.

1734
01:57:36.958 --> 01:57:38.539
Arriving at our new home.

1735
01:57:38.542 --> 01:57:41.079
Becoming a new planet
of the targeted stellar system.

1736
01:57:41.083 --> 01:57:44.746
Don't you dare call me hu kou.
Where are your manners?

1737
01:57:46.667 --> 01:57:47.667
Call me brother.

1738
01:57:47.875 --> 01:57:49.160
Liu qi.

1739
01:57:49.375 --> 01:57:51.536
Junior driver.

1740
01:57:51.542 --> 01:57:54.784
Beijing no. 3 transportation
division reminds you.

1741
01:57:54.958 --> 01:57:57.244
Routes are countless.

1742
01:57:57.250 --> 01:57:59.662
Safety is foremost.

1743
01:57:59.667 --> 01:58:01.578
With unregulated driving.

1744
01:58:01.583 --> 01:58:04.370
Your loved ones might end up in tears.

1745
01:58:07.750 --> 01:58:09.035
Driving rules violated.
Deduct three points.

1746
01:58:09.042 --> 01:58:11.203
Can you drive? Liu hu kou!

1747
01:58:11.417 --> 01:58:14.489
Li yiyi! You're distracting
my vision with that bag!

1748
01:58:14.542 --> 01:58:17.579
My fault?

1749
01:58:17.583 --> 01:58:21.371
How am I blocking your vision
when I'm sitting behind you?

1750
01:58:21.375 --> 01:58:24.697
This project will last for 100 generations.

1751
01:58:26.125 --> 01:58:29.492
We are unaware of what the new sun
at 4.2 light years away

1752
01:58:29.500 --> 01:58:31.331
will bring to our new home though.

1753
01:58:31.333 --> 01:58:34.780
But from this day on.
The courage and perseverance of mankind

1754
01:58:34.792 --> 01:58:37.158
will be etched among the stars.

1755
01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:40.037
This long voyage of hope and despair.

1756
01:58:40.042 --> 01:58:43.205
Enduring 2.500 years through the cosmos.

1757
01:58:43.208 --> 01:58:44.493
Is known as

1758
01:58:44.667 --> 01:58:47.704
the wandering earth project.
