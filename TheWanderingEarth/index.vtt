01:46.772 --> 01:48.308
Where are you going?

01:49.064 --> 01:50.645
Dad is going on a mission.

01:51.189 --> 01:53.225
The most important mission in the world.


17:22.980 --> 17:24.265
Shit! Fuck!


17:34.855 --> 17:36.595
Watch out!


17:43.730 --> 17:47.052
The world outside is huge!

17:47.105 --> 17:50.177
What are you yelling about?
So embarrassing!

17:50.814 --> 17:52.645
Such strong winds today.

17:52.647 --> 17:54.638
Why are they mining these mountains?


17:54.647 --> 17:55.887
For fuel.

17:56.022 --> 17:58.058
Heavy fusion propulsion technology.

17:58.064 --> 17:59.725
Basically.

17:59.980 --> 18:01.686
Basically. It's burning rocks.

18:01.689 --> 18:03.270
The earth engine!

18:03.272 --> 18:05.433
These are propulsion engines.


18:05.439 --> 18:08.886
There are 10.000 of them around the globe.
Made for pushing earth forward.

18:08.897 --> 18:10.433
This isn't the most gigantic one.

18:10.439 --> 18:12.304
Those torque engines along the equator.

18:12.314 --> 18:15.181
They are the real giants.







01:57.939 --> 01:59.600
After I leave.

01:59.605 --> 02:01.516
You'll be liu qi's only custodian.

02:03.105 --> 02:04.515
You shall obtain the right

02:04.522 --> 02:07.685
of underground city residency
without drawing the lots.




19:31.689 --> 19:33.930
Synchronal translation is on.

19:34.189 --> 19:35.349
Buddy.

19:35.689 --> 19:37.099
Happy retirement.


19:42.522 --> 19:44.228
One more day until I go home.

19:44.230 --> 19:45.595
Don't mess up my last dignity.

19:45.772 --> 19:47.603
Save this moonshine for yourself.


19:47.647 --> 19:50.604
I will store it somewhere safe for you.

19:50.605 --> 19:52.641
Save it for your farewell party.

19:52.730 --> 19:55.221
We are not getting another chance
once we hibernate.


20:02.689 --> 20:04.429
Don't you know

20:04.439 --> 20:08.728
how vodka was smuggled up
during gagarin's time?



20:20.897 --> 20:22.933
We'll be entering Jupiter's
orbit today. Right?

20:22.939 --> 20:27.558
Yes. We have already stood by for
emergency protocol no. 3.

20:27.939 --> 20:30.021
Something doesn't feel right.


20:30.022 --> 20:31.432
There's no other way. Earth can't

20:31.439 --> 20:33.054
leave the solar system
without utilizing Jupiter's gravity.

20:33.064 --> 20:34.520
It is a risk we must take.

20:34.605 --> 20:36.846
God will bless us.

20:37.605 --> 20:39.596
Once this is over. You can return home.


20:41.564 --> 20:43.520
It's the last procedure
for daily inspection.

20:43.980 --> 20:46.266
Check the centrifugal drive control unit.

20:46.272 --> 20:48.513
Record the temperatures
of centrifugal axle bearings.


02:08.397 --> 02:09.853
And it is the only way

02:11.272 --> 02:12.728
to ensure that both you and liu qi

02:14.105 --> 02:15.515
will survive.


20:51.689 --> 20:52.689
Understood.


21:02.397 --> 21:05.229
Liu peigiang has completed
handover procedure.

21:05.230 --> 21:06.811
Lieutenant colonel liu peigiang.

21:06.814 --> 21:07.849
Until today.

21:07.855 --> 21:10.722
You have accumulated a resting time
of 12 years and 3 days in total.

21:10.730 --> 21:13.597
An accumulated shift of 5
years and 14 days total.


21:13.605 --> 21:16.187
We are grateful for your contributions
for the past 17 years.

21:16.189 --> 21:19.386
Congratulations on your duty completion
and journey home tomorrow.



21:33.605 --> 21:34.605
Brother.

21:35.939 --> 21:38.976
See you on earth three years later.

21:39.189 --> 21:41.305
Go catch up with your son.

21:41.689 --> 21:43.645
You haven't spoken to him
for almost a decade.


21:48.564 --> 21:49.724
See you on earth.


21:56.022 --> 21:57.603
Bro.

21:57.980 --> 22:00.972
You'll be spending
the next three years with me now.



22:23.189 --> 22:25.271
Jupiter's gravitational spike detected.


22:25.689 --> 22:28.761
Earth's trajectory is off
course by 9.23 degrees.

22:28.980 --> 22:30.971
Due to Jupiter's gravitational spike.

22:31.314 --> 22:34.056
The probability of colliding
with Jupiter increases.

22:34.064 --> 22:35.725
Analyzing data collected.


02:18.439 --> 02:19.394
This is the only choice...

02:19.397 --> 02:21.433
That's enough. I get it.


22:35.730 --> 22:37.812
Transmitting to the ueg

22:37.980 --> 22:40.972
disaster warning protocols activated.


22:50.147 --> 22:52.980
There's a supply depot 50 km ahead.


22:56.689 --> 22:58.099
Once we get there.

22:58.189 --> 22:59.554
You go back by yourself.

23:00.522 --> 23:01.853
Catch the earliest shuttle back.

23:01.855 --> 23:03.811
So grandpa won't worry about us.

23:04.272 --> 23:05.603
Oh. Come on.


23:05.605 --> 23:08.597
You would be clenched by the collar
once your dad gets back.

23:09.189 --> 23:12.386
I'm a genius. No one is
capable of clenching me.

23:12.814 --> 23:13.929
What the...

23:13.939 --> 23:15.304
Car inspection.


23:17.189 --> 23:18.554
How did you get in here?

23:18.814 --> 23:19.473
Unregulated...

23:19.480 --> 23:20.686
Unregulated driving.

23:20.689 --> 23:21.678
Unregulated?

23:21.689 --> 23:22.929
You committed thievery!

23:22.939 --> 23:25.396
I didn't steal. I just borrowed it.
It's my grandpa's vehicle pass.

23:25.397 --> 23:28.469
Nonsense. All transporters belong to
the ueg as public properties.


23:28.480 --> 23:30.596
It's not up to your grandpa!

23:32.730 --> 23:34.015
What are you doing?

23:34.022 --> 23:34.886
It's way past bedtime!

23:34.897 --> 23:36.012
Sir.

23:36.272 --> 23:38.638
I'm just getting to know new friends.


23:38.647 --> 23:40.888
More friends. More options.

23:40.897 --> 23:42.478
Hand over.

23:43.439 --> 23:44.929
You think it is yours?

23:44.939 --> 23:46.679
Hit the sack.


23:47.730 --> 23:48.970
Have a nice stroll.

23:50.439 --> 23:51.804
I am Tim.

23:52.272 --> 23:54.638
My dad is from Beijing.
And my mom is from Melbourne.

23:54.647 --> 23:55.557
A Chinese and Australian joint product.

23:55.564 --> 23:56.974
Come on. I was just joking.

23:56.980 --> 23:58.311
Let's shake hands?


24:02.439 --> 24:03.428
Hello.

24:03.439 --> 24:04.849
Joint product.

24:04.855 --> 24:06.220
It hurts. Let go of me.

24:06.230 --> 24:07.230
It hurts!


24:17.730 --> 24:19.595
Name of the visitor?


02:31.480 --> 02:32.595
Father.

02:34.980 --> 02:36.641
Sorry.


24:20.355 --> 24:21.561
Han ziang.

24:21.730 --> 24:24.392
I'm here for my grandson.



24:42.147 --> 24:44.058
Someone's getting bailed.

24:49.522 --> 24:50.728
Sir.


24:50.730 --> 24:52.641
My grandson is a mechanic trainee.

24:52.647 --> 24:54.137
He just wanted to touch the real thing.

24:54.147 --> 24:57.514
May you go easy on him.

24:58.689 --> 25:01.396
Transporters are highly
valuable public property.


25:02.105 --> 25:06.018
Lending out your vehicle pass privately
is also a serious offense.

25:09.980 --> 25:11.936
This is good stuff.


25:12.064 --> 25:14.225
It has a collection of hotties
from the past 50 years.

25:14.522 --> 25:16.137
It's all in.

25:18.147 --> 25:19.262
Oh. Well.


25:22.272 --> 25:23.637
Same old trick.


25:40.980 --> 25:42.595
Stop wobbling. Old man!


25:48.855 --> 25:50.516
What old man?

25:50.522 --> 25:52.604
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.


25:52.605 --> 25:53.515
Running away from home.

25:53.522 --> 25:55.228
You're too old to be running away.

25:55.230 --> 25:56.185
He is your father anyhow.

25:56.189 --> 25:57.395
Where are you going to hide?

25:57.397 --> 25:58.762
You even brought your little sister out?

25:58.772 --> 26:01.058
Outside is dangerous!

26:01.397 --> 26:02.807
And you!


02:43.105 --> 02:44.140
At first.

02:44.147 --> 02:46.934
Nobody cared about this disaster.


26:05.105 --> 26:07.061
You've learned to steal!

26:08.605 --> 26:09.890
You stole my pass!

26:09.897 --> 26:12.013
Should you do whatever
your brother told you to do?

26:12.272 --> 26:13.603
Are you dumb?


26:14.522 --> 26:16.058
I didn't intend to bring her along.
But she was begging me...

26:16.064 --> 26:17.554
As a brother...

26:17.564 --> 26:18.564
To take her.

26:18.647 --> 26:20.808
Liu qi! You liar!

26:20.814 --> 26:22.145
Here she goes again.

26:22.147 --> 26:23.808
Nicely said!


26:23.814 --> 26:25.475
Ignore senior's advice...

26:25.480 --> 26:27.061
Mind your own business!

26:27.064 --> 26:28.144
Don't take it out on the wall.

26:28.147 --> 26:30.354
Take it out on me if you dare.

26:30.355 --> 26:32.391
What the...


26:39.689 --> 26:40.348
Earthquake!

26:40.355 --> 26:41.640
Shi San yao!

26:41.647 --> 26:42.978
I won!



26:59.439 --> 27:00.554
Open the door!

27:00.564 --> 27:02.145
Anyone?

27:02.272 --> 27:03.603
Open the door!

27:03.605 --> 27:05.345
Here!


27:07.772 --> 27:09.854
- Hurry up! Open the door!
- Here!

27:13.605 --> 27:14.515
Warning.

27:14.522 --> 27:16.729
Earth engine system failing.


27:16.730 --> 27:19.642
Total. 121 facilities.

27:19.647 --> 27:20.682
Correction.

27:23.355 --> 27:24.355
Correction.


27:26.355 --> 27:28.186
Don't leave me!

27:28.189 --> 27:30.726
Help! Is anyone there?

27:30.730 --> 27:32.937
My mom needs me and my kid...

27:32.939 --> 27:34.850
I don't even have a kid yet!

27:34.855 --> 27:35.970
Hey!

27:35.980 --> 27:37.720
Please help me. Man.


27:37.730 --> 27:39.220
- Hu kou.
- Come on.

27:39.230 --> 27:40.970
- Hu kou. Come back.
- Come here.

27:40.980 --> 27:42.095
Grab the key.

27:42.105 --> 27:44.517
The key! The key is pinned underneath.

27:44.522 --> 27:46.934
What's this? You can't pull this apart!


02:47.439 --> 02:49.430
It's just another wildfire.

02:51.689 --> 02:53.099
Another drought.

02:55.814 --> 02:57.520
Another extinction of species.


27:51.397 --> 27:53.103
Hurry up!

27:53.772 --> 27:55.057
Wait for me.




28:20.689 --> 28:22.520
Engine no. 7 has stopped.

28:22.522 --> 28:24.228
Engine no. 3 has stopped.

28:24.564 --> 28:27.931
Get the chief engineer! Quick!


28:30.355 --> 28:32.721
Due to Jupiter's gravitational spike.

28:32.730 --> 28:34.686
Earth's propulsion has been halved.

28:34.689 --> 28:36.554
Torques lost completely.

28:36.564 --> 28:39.271
In 37 hours 4 minutes 12 seconds.


28:39.272 --> 28:41.103
The earth will collide with Jupiter.

28:48.480 --> 28:51.062
Han ziang. Senior driver.


28:51.064 --> 28:54.101
Beijing no. 3 transportation
division reminds you.

28:54.105 --> 28:55.766
Routes are countless.

28:55.772 --> 28:57.808
Safety is foremost.

28:57.814 --> 28:59.429
With unregulated driving.

28:59.439 --> 29:00.895
Your loved ones might end up in tears.


29:00.897 --> 29:02.307
Shut up. Stupid!

29:02.314 --> 29:03.394
Move it!




03:01.314 --> 03:03.225
Another vanishing city.

03:04.564 --> 03:08.637
Until everyone is entwined
with this disaster.


29:32.939 --> 29:34.850
Hu kou! Detach!


29:44.355 --> 29:45.355
Hu kou!

29:47.022 --> 29:49.138
I feel dizzy.




30:16.730 --> 30:20.803
Top priority from ueg.

30:20.814 --> 30:22.520
To all standby forces on earth.

30:22.522 --> 30:24.183
Due to Jupiter's gravitational spike.


30:24.189 --> 30:28.432
A total of 4.771 earth engines
have shut down globally.

30:28.439 --> 30:29.975
To avoid collision with Jupiter.

30:29.980 --> 30:33.268
Every unit must execute emergency
protocol no. 3 and depart immediately.

30:33.272 --> 30:37.515
It's imperative to restart
all malfunctioning engines within 36 hours.


30:37.522 --> 30:38.602
This rescue mission

30:38.605 --> 30:42.177
concerns the survival of
3.5 billion human lives.

30:42.189 --> 30:44.976
This mission is to be above all else.


30:44.980 --> 30:46.891
At any cost.

30:52.147 --> 30:53.683
Rescue units are on the go!

30:53.689 --> 30:57.728
In order to expedite the rescue.
All resources will be consolidated.


30:57.730 --> 31:01.302
The space station will be
implementing a low consumption mode.

31:01.314 --> 31:02.748
Lisa. Low consumption mode implemented.

31:02.772 --> 31:04.728
Regular communication services
will be cut off shortly.


31:04.730 --> 31:06.686
Low consumption mode activated.

31:06.730 --> 31:07.685
I just got here.

31:07.730 --> 31:09.686
How could I know about hibernation?

31:10.689 --> 31:12.680
Moss. Please contact my relative.

31:12.689 --> 31:13.689
Contact liu qi.

31:13.730 --> 31:15.686
Liu qi isn't in the allocated living area.


03:10.605 --> 03:14.928
The sun is rapidly
degenerating and expanding.

03:15.105 --> 03:19.348
The sun will engulf earth in 100 years.


31:16.397 --> 31:17.887
Connection failed.

31:19.064 --> 31:21.976
Moss. Contact transporter driver han ziang.


31:26.647 --> 31:28.387
Incoming connection.

31:32.105 --> 31:34.096
Peigiang? Is that you?

31:34.439 --> 31:35.724
Father. It's me.

31:35.730 --> 31:37.220
Have you seen liu qi?


31:37.689 --> 31:39.429
Liu qi is right here with me.

31:39.730 --> 31:41.595
We just ran into an earthquake.

31:41.605 --> 31:43.061
We are on the outside surface now.

31:43.355 --> 31:45.061
Moss. Locate the transporter

31:45.064 --> 31:47.430
and guide it to the nearest refuge center.


31:47.439 --> 31:49.270
What's there to say to him?

31:49.272 --> 31:52.264
Transporter 373. Driver han ziang.

31:52.272 --> 31:55.639
Please proceed to jinan no.
5 refuge center.


32:00.647 --> 32:03.604
Space station flight
configuration completed.

32:03.605 --> 32:07.348
All personnel. Enter hibernation
for energy conservation.


32:07.605 --> 32:11.553
Hibernation rate at 77.3%.

32:11.564 --> 32:13.225
Lieutenant colonel liu peigiang.

32:13.230 --> 32:16.142
Please proceed towards
hibernation unit quickly.


32:18.147 --> 32:20.604
Low consumption mode activated.

32:20.605 --> 32:24.928
Consolidation of all resources to
expedite global rescue mission.

32:25.397 --> 32:29.686
Initiating global surface scan
and complete network coverage.



32:40.855 --> 32:42.220
What's this?

32:42.230 --> 32:44.972
Emergency communication
authorization code of liu qi's dad.

32:45.480 --> 32:47.892
It's a direct line to the space station.

Don't be afraid.

38:04.147 --> 38:06.263
This was grandpa's home.

38:07.272 --> 38:09.058
Look at those tall buildings.

38:09.480 --> 38:12.597
A lot of people used to live there.

to construct 10.000 earth engines
on the planet's surface

03:58.897 --> 04:02.185
to propel earth out of the solar system.


38:13.397 --> 38:14.807
Back then.

38:17.730 --> 38:21.848
Everyone was concerned
about the thing that is called money.


38:23.522 --> 38:26.969
Grandpa couldn't make a
lot of money back then.

38:26.980 --> 38:29.596
But I was happy every day.

38:29.980 --> 38:32.016
Especially on my way home.

38:32.022 --> 38:34.388
I could always smell your grandma's cooking


38:34.397 --> 38:37.594
from far away.

38:38.730 --> 38:42.473
Actually. She could barely cook.

38:42.480 --> 38:44.937
Except for the scallion noodles.


38:44.939 --> 38:46.054
I tell you.

38:46.064 --> 38:48.430
Her scallion noodles

38:49.522 --> 38:51.934
are incredibly salty.

38:52.689 --> 38:54.680
But I slurped it all up.

Your son will be safe.


39:19.230 --> 39:20.230
Moss.

39:20.397 --> 39:21.933
Where is liu qi now?


39:24.689 --> 39:25.929
Why are they in Shanghai?

39:25.939 --> 39:27.679
Transporter 373

39:27.689 --> 39:29.645
has been integrated into

Please instruct.

39:50.772 --> 39:51.761
Captain wang lei.

39:51.772 --> 39:52.807
Within protocols.

39:52.814 --> 39:54.304
Please resettle the civilians

39:54.314 --> 39:56.350
into the nearest underground city quickly.


04:02.980 --> 04:05.722
The height of every propulsion engine
is 11.000 meters.

04:05.730 --> 04:08.802
They will provide a total
of 150 trillion propulsive force for earth.

04:09.189 --> 04:10.189
Salute!


39:56.689 --> 39:57.849
Lieutenant liu peigiang.

39:57.855 --> 40:00.722
We have an urgent rescue mission.
Thanks for your understanding.

40:00.730 --> 40:03.392
I'll resettle the civilians
at the jiaxing refuge center.

40:03.397 --> 40:04.978
But the transporter
has a special operating system.

40:04.980 --> 40:07.642
We need driver han ziang to stay.


40:07.855 --> 40:09.186
Over.

40:12.522 --> 40:13.602
Captain wang lei.

40:13.939 --> 40:16.021
This is a dangerous rescue mission.

40:16.022 --> 40:16.807
Please ensure the safety of han ziang.


40:16.814 --> 40:19.305
I stay! I can drive
this transporter. Too.

40:19.314 --> 40:22.977
When we arrive at jiaxing.
Let grandpa and the others get off.


40:27.564 --> 40:29.475
You can operate shit.

40:29.480 --> 40:30.765
Just follow the orders!

40:31.064 --> 40:33.680
Captain wang lei. He is still a kid.

40:34.647 --> 40:35.477
He is not capable...

40:35.480 --> 40:37.892
What rights do you have
to make decisions for me?


40:39.022 --> 40:40.228
My mom's death

40:40.647 --> 40:42.933
was your decision.

40:43.439 --> 40:44.804
Liu qi. What are you talking about?

40:44.814 --> 40:46.270
Am I wrong?


40:48.855 --> 40:50.220
After I left.

40:52.189 --> 40:55.636
Only one custodian can accompany
liu qi into underground city.

40:56.230 --> 40:59.267
She's gravely ill. She
won't hold up much longer.


41:00.522 --> 41:01.887
Giving up on the treatment

41:05.064 --> 41:07.555
this is the only way to ensure
both of you and liu qi

41:08.105 --> 41:09.595
can survive.


41:10.105 --> 41:12.221
That's enough. I get it.

41:15.522 --> 41:16.853
So be it.

41:18.939 --> 41:19.939
Father.


41:23.814 --> 41:24.814
Sorry.

41:29.189 --> 41:32.431
Mayday!


41:32.439 --> 41:33.178

41:44.480 --> 41:45.845
Mayday!

41:45.855 --> 41:47.561
Atmospheric pressure is dropping.

41:47.564 --> 41:49.850
Moss. What's the status on earth?

41:49.855 --> 41:51.766
Jupiter's gravitational spike detected.


41:51.772 --> 41:54.844
All surface communications
in Shanghai area were lost.

41:58.189 --> 41:59.645
All alert!

41:59.647 --> 42:01.353
An object is crashing to our rear!


42:04.397 --> 42:05.397
Moss.

42:05.522 --> 42:06.932
Report surface status!

42:06.939 --> 42:08.850
Due to Jupiter's gravitational spike.

42:08.855 --> 42:11.346
The earth is experiencing
global aftershocks.


42:11.355 --> 42:15.553
Tectonic plates fracturing
in Asia and pacific.


42:28.355 --> 42:29.435
The glass.

42:30.855 --> 42:32.811
The glass is going to crack.


42:33.855 --> 42:34.719
Oh. My god!

42:34.730 --> 42:36.971
Am I going to die here?

42:37.314 --> 42:38.770
Death is normal.

42:38.772 --> 42:39.852
What?

42:42.397 --> 42:45.013
All units! Helmets on!


42:52.772 --> 42:54.057
What are you doing?


42:55.689 --> 42:56.644
Let go!

42:56.647 --> 42:57.932
Go away!

42:58.647 --> 42:59.978
Let go!

43:00.564 --> 43:01.599
Two hundred meters ahead!

43:01.605 --> 43:03.141
Collapse alert!


43:05.272 --> 43:06.136
Full speed reverse!

43:06.147 --> 43:07.147
Move!


43:14.897 --> 43:16.853
Move!


04:20.980 --> 04:22.345
Meanwhile.

04:22.355 --> 04:24.812
To safeguard earth's trajectory.

04:24.814 --> 04:27.646
The united earth government consolidated
global astronautical capabilities

04:27.647 --> 04:31.970
and spent 30 years to build the navigation
platform international space station.


43:28.272 --> 43:31.184
Extreme turbulences at earth's atmosphere.

43:56.855 --> 43:58.937
Moss. Open the cabin!

43:58.939 --> 44:00.554
This is defection!



44:22.105 --> 44:23.265
Help!

44:23.355 --> 44:24.765
I don't want to die here!

44:24.772 --> 44:27.559
Help!


44:29.064 --> 44:31.601
Didn't you say death was normal?

44:33.814 --> 44:36.226
Help!

44:36.272 --> 44:37.387
Boss.


44:37.439 --> 44:38.975
We've lost contact with the other units.

44:38.980 --> 44:40.470
I can't reach them!

44:40.480 --> 44:42.141
Da gang. Transport the
lighter core with me!

44:42.147 --> 44:43.262
Chui zi. Ya tou. Save the others.

44:43.272 --> 44:44.011
Liu zi. Find a way out!

44:44.022 --> 44:44.932
Everyone. Abandon the vehicle!

44:44.939 --> 44:45.974
Yes!


44:49.189 --> 44:50.189
Go!

44:52.314 --> 44:53.895
Get in!

44:57.689 --> 44:59.600
Quick! Get in. Quick!


45:00.480 --> 45:02.220
Help!

45:03.397 --> 45:04.352
What's going on?

45:04.355 --> 45:05.219
How are you guys doing?

45:05.230 --> 45:07.642
- Stay calm. We'll get you out now.
- Hurry up!


04:34.897 --> 04:36.478
The navigation platform
international space station will travel

04:36.480 --> 04:39.392
with a relative position
of 100.000 km to earth.

04:39.439 --> 04:43.512
It will provide warnings. Navigations.
And communications for earth.


45:13.730 --> 45:15.812
Normal.

45:15.814 --> 45:18.430
Old man. Quick on feet.


45:29.022 --> 45:31.559
Boss. The lighter core
is in good condition.


45:34.272 --> 45:37.639
Still hauling this damn ball now?

45:38.105 --> 45:39.766
Among all the lighter cores
that were meant for hangzhou.


45:39.772 --> 45:41.933
This is the last one.

45:41.939 --> 45:43.770
We've lost all our units.

45:43.772 --> 45:45.888
This lighter core is hangzhou's only hope.

45:45.897 --> 45:47.558
Nice speech.

45:47.689 --> 45:50.522
But what about the two kids here?



46:02.939 --> 46:05.225
Boss. This building looks intact.

46:05.439 --> 46:07.680
We can try to climb up from inside.

46:07.855 --> 46:08.685
Good.

46:08.689 --> 46:10.645
Let's get the lighter core out now.





46:42.272 --> 46:45.890
- Liu zi. Find a way out.
- Roger.

46:51.397 --> 46:53.888
Gang zi. Zhou qian. Load the lighter core.


04:49.314 --> 04:51.805
Centrifugal drive activated.


47:01.522 --> 47:03.228
Hold on.


47:03.939 --> 47:05.520
Load people first.

47:09.230 --> 47:10.230
Load

47:10.689 --> 47:12.145
people.


47:16.689 --> 47:17.769
Stop wasting time.

47:17.772 --> 47:19.452
Load the lighter core and people together!

47:22.855 --> 47:23.810
Slow down.


47:23.814 --> 47:25.975
I have acrophobia.

47:33.147 --> 47:35.684
Boss. I found an opening


47:35.689 --> 47:38.726
we can't use dynamite here!
This building is crumbling.

47:43.272 --> 47:46.389
Chui zi. Liu zi. Whoever here!
Make a way out!


47:47.355 --> 47:49.516
Ya tou. You take over.


48:00.522 --> 48:01.887
Hu kou! Grandpa!

48:01.897 --> 48:03.228
Hurry up!

48:04.689 --> 48:06.725
Gang zi. Report the position
of the lighter core.


48:06.730 --> 48:09.802
50th floor. Below han ziang!

48:15.605 --> 48:17.141
Here it is!


48:17.522 --> 48:18.932
Right here! The thinnest part!

48:18.939 --> 48:19.974
Thin? What thin?

48:19.980 --> 48:22.096
- I'll leave this to you.
- Okay.



04:52.439 --> 04:55.351
Worldwide sea level will rise
300 meters within 10 years.

04:55.355 --> 04:58.275
Haikou and zhanjiang of our country
will be attacked by the Tsunami first.

04:58.397 --> 05:00.934
To deal with the continuous
deteriorating condition.

05:01.272 --> 05:03.513
Ueg constructed one adjacent city


48:45.647 --> 48:46.932
The pulley can't hold longer.

48:46.939 --> 48:47.928
Pull up the lighter core.


48:47.939 --> 48:49.395
Are you okay. Old man?

48:49.397 --> 48:51.137
Leave me! Go up quickly!

48:55.480 --> 48:58.677
- Go up quickly.
- Wang lei! Pull my grandfather up!


48:59.605 --> 49:01.687
Gang zi. Position.

49:02.230 --> 49:05.097
Lighter core is now on the 75th floor.

49:05.730 --> 49:06.970
Quick!


49:12.689 --> 49:14.225
Old man!



49:31.064 --> 49:33.680
Get up here. You old man!


49:43.439 --> 49:46.272
Wang lei. I can't hold it any more!

49:49.522 --> 49:52.935
Old man!



50:08.355 --> 50:10.721
Let me go. Kid.


50:12.355 --> 50:16.644
Grandpa!

50:17.189 --> 50:18.929
Gang zi!


05:03.522 --> 05:06.104
beneath each earth engine.

05:07.147 --> 05:09.729
Before earth's arrival at its new home.

05:09.730 --> 05:11.470
These will be the only refuge for mankind.

05:11.480 --> 05:15.553
The right to underground residency
will be obtained by drawing lots.



50:38.439 --> 50:39.439
Boss.

50:39.689 --> 50:40.849
Gang zi is gone.




51:08.689 --> 51:09.929
Stop dazing.

51:09.939 --> 51:11.099
Han ziang is gone.

51:11.105 --> 51:12.686
Get them two out of here.


51:13.355 --> 51:14.595
Liu qi.

51:15.147 --> 51:19.015
- Duoduo. Let's move.
- Liu qi.

51:22.230 --> 51:23.436
Hu kou.


51:23.480 --> 51:24.595
Hu kou.

51:24.855 --> 51:26.391
Are you and duoduo

51:26.689 --> 51:27.724
safe?

51:31.689 --> 51:32.599
Old man.

51:32.605 --> 51:33.765
Let's go.


51:33.772 --> 51:35.308
Where are you. Old man?

51:35.314 --> 51:36.679
I'm coming to get you.

51:36.689 --> 51:39.601
Grandpa.

51:39.772 --> 51:42.935
I'm sorry. Grandpa.



51:54.939 --> 51:57.305
Hu kou. Save grandpa!

51:57.314 --> 52:00.056
Liu qi. You save grandpa!

52:00.064 --> 52:02.305
Where are you. Old man?

52:02.689 --> 52:05.101
Oxygen: 1%



05:15.564 --> 05:17.725
The lottery result can't be transferred.
Borrowed. Or gifted.

05:17.730 --> 05:19.891
Till now. Mankind.

05:19.897 --> 05:22.889
A tiny tribe in the solar system.




52:35.064 --> 52:38.602
On the 17th day after the
earth stopped spinning.


52:39.230 --> 52:41.562
I saved a child.

52:42.980 --> 52:47.098
She was handed over to
me by countless hands.


52:49.689 --> 52:52.681
I don't know who her parents were.

52:54.064 --> 52:56.680
Every soul under the water


52:57.397 --> 52:59.638
is her mother and father.

53:02.689 --> 53:05.647
I named her han duoduo.

53:07.230 --> 53:10.097
I named her after my daughter.


53:10.147 --> 53:10.727
Grandpa!

53:10.772 --> 53:12.763
I am so sorry. Old man.

53:12.772 --> 53:13.932
My grandchildren.

53:13.939 --> 53:15.725
- Don't be afraid.
- Come up now!

53:15.730 --> 53:16.730
From then on.

53:17.314 --> 53:19.396
We are a family.



53:30.230 --> 53:31.640
Hu kou.

53:32.355 --> 53:33.765
As a brother.

53:35.647 --> 53:38.059
You have to watch over your sister.


53:39.105 --> 53:41.812
Take duoduo home.


05:23.147 --> 05:25.559
Will be embarking upon 2.500 years

05:25.564 --> 05:27.100
of wandering voyage.

05:27.730 --> 05:30.893
The surface temperature will drop to
minus 70 degrees celsius this year.

05:30.897 --> 05:33.809
All surface residents from different


53:52.689 --> 53:54.475
Grandpa!

53:54.480 --> 53:55.845
Duoduo.

53:56.189 --> 53:57.520
- It's dangerous.
- Duoduo.

53:57.522 --> 53:59.558
- Step back.
- Duoduo.


54:02.689 --> 54:05.101
Why didn't you save my grandpa?


54:11.855 --> 54:13.470
This is our fate!

54:13.480 --> 54:15.266
Let my brother go!

54:16.605 --> 54:17.605
Duoduo.

54:19.939 --> 54:22.646
- Chui zi. Ya tou. Take them away.
- Roger.


54:25.897 --> 54:26.636
Don't touch her.

54:26.647 --> 54:28.854
Duoduo. It's dangerous.

54:28.855 --> 54:30.220
Stop moving.


54:32.189 --> 54:34.350
You will both freeze to death here!

54:34.689 --> 54:36.429
I'm not leaving with you.

54:36.439 --> 54:38.646
I'm going home with my brother.

54:38.772 --> 54:41.388
Boss. If we march to
hangzhou at full speed.


54:41.397 --> 54:43.308
It should take us three
hours to get to hangzhou.

54:43.314 --> 54:44.599
The transporter is gone.

54:45.855 --> 54:50.554
I'm no use to you anymore.


54:54.689 --> 54:57.180
Leave them with the backup supplies
and a military navigation!

54:57.272 --> 54:57.852
Let's move!

54:57.855 --> 54:59.345
Hangzhou awaits.

54:59.647 --> 55:01.262
Duoduo. Let's go home.


55:03.439 --> 55:05.896
Grandpa is gone.

55:06.147 --> 55:09.469
Where is our home?



55:28.897 --> 55:31.309
Warning. Unauthorized awakening.

55:31.314 --> 55:33.555
Hibernation mode compromised.


05:35.397 --> 05:37.729
- slowly.
- Don't push!


55:34.647 --> 55:37.059
Warning. Unauthorized awakening.

55:37.064 --> 55:39.555
Hibernation mode compromised.



56:01.814 --> 56:03.725
By the contingency regulations.

56:03.730 --> 56:06.563
Activating manual rectification procedure.


56:06.564 --> 56:10.887
Awaken personnel of unit h-7x01.

56:14.772 --> 56:16.603
Lieutenant colonel makarov.


56:16.605 --> 56:18.220
Lieutenant colonel hamdan.

56:18.230 --> 56:20.642
According to contingency regulations.

56:20.647 --> 56:23.013
Please rectify accidental awakening.

56:23.022 --> 56:26.139
Incident no. H-71.


56:26.147 --> 56:28.513
According to contingency regulations.

56:28.522 --> 56:30.854
Please rectify accidental awakening.

56:30.855 --> 56:33.517
Incident no. H-71.


56:36.897 --> 56:38.353
Liu peigiang.

56:38.355 --> 56:39.344
What are you doing?

56:39.355 --> 56:40.470
The space station has ran off track!

56:40.480 --> 56:42.516
Earth's communications
will soon be paralyzed.

56:43.397 --> 56:44.978
People on earth are abandoned.

56:44.980 --> 56:46.516
My son is still out there!


56:46.522 --> 56:48.262
Have you lost your mind?
Because of your son?

56:48.272 --> 56:50.228
We're in low consumption mode.

56:50.230 --> 56:52.596
You will be handed over
to the military court!

56:52.772 --> 56:54.512
Low consumption mode is a ruse!

56:54.522 --> 56:55.887
See it for yourself.


56:58.230 --> 57:00.221
Perhaps moss is malfunctioning.

57:01.314 --> 57:02.850
It's defection!

57:04.855 --> 57:06.686
What are you planning to do?


57:07.564 --> 57:10.226
Head to the central control module.
Stop the space station.

57:13.230 --> 57:14.811
Will all violators

57:14.814 --> 57:16.930
stop contact immediately with earth

57:16.939 --> 57:19.396
and return to hibernation area.



57:20.814 --> 57:24.887
Liu. Are you sure we have
to go via this airlock?

57:24.897 --> 57:28.515
Makarov. Maybe you shouldn't come with me.


57:28.855 --> 57:30.436
You won't make it without me.

57:30.439 --> 57:34.352
Do you think you know
the exterior like I do?

57:34.355 --> 57:35.219
Don't forget

57:35.230 --> 57:37.221
we Russians invented space
station 100 years ago.


57:42.355 --> 57:44.186
The airlock isn't designed for exiting.

57:44.189 --> 57:45.589
Are you sure this is going to work?

57:47.272 --> 57:48.272
I'm sure.


57:50.980 --> 57:51.969
We want to take our kids

57:51.980 --> 57:53.811
go salmon fishing on lake baikal.

57:53.814 --> 57:55.975
I'd rather have hotpot in Chongqing.

57:58.355 --> 58:00.061
The central control module is coming.


58:02.980 --> 58:06.802
Russian cosmonauts are
invincible in the space.


58:10.314 --> 58:11.804
Grab me. Liu peigiang!

58:11.814 --> 58:13.770
I don't want to die!

58:16.439 --> 58:17.178
Makarov!

58:17.189 --> 58:19.271
Quick! Pull quickly!


58:21.814 --> 58:22.814
Go.

58:29.064 --> 58:32.352
It's probably much better to just sleep
in the hibernation unit.


58:32.689 --> 58:36.432
Jupiter has captured earth's atmosphere.

58:38.189 --> 58:40.305
Oh. My god!


58:46.439 --> 58:47.599
Over there!

58:47.980 --> 58:50.266
The distress signal is coming from there.


58:52.689 --> 58:55.396
Even the plane of the air
rescue unit has crashed.


05:56.564 --> 05:58.304
Dad will fly up into the sky

05:58.939 --> 06:00.554
and turn into a star

06:01.022 --> 06:02.432
to always watch over you.

06:04.272 --> 06:05.387
Dad.


59:05.064 --> 59:07.180
An intact transporter.

59:07.980 --> 59:10.312
Should be the source of
the distress signal.

59:11.397 --> 59:12.728
I'll check the transporter.


59:12.730 --> 59:13.765
You all go on board for shelter.

59:13.772 --> 59:16.229
Search for anything useful.


59:23.230 --> 59:24.345
Come on!

59:24.355 --> 59:25.094
Liu qi!

59:25.105 --> 59:26.265
Come on!

59:27.314 --> 59:30.226
Come on! I'm going to kill her!


59:33.730 --> 59:35.311
Come over. Quick!

59:35.730 --> 59:36.970
You! Calm down!

59:37.064 --> 59:38.975
We are also a rescue unit.


59:45.939 --> 59:46.939
It's okay.

59:47.397 --> 59:48.397
Calm down.

59:48.647 --> 59:50.012
Calm down.


59:58.397 --> 01:00:00.137
The mission of our air force rescue unit

01:00:00.147 --> 01:00:02.433
is to restart the torque
engines along the equator.

01:00:03.397 --> 01:00:05.957
But Jupiter's gravitational force
has thinned out our atmosphere.


01:00:07.189 --> 01:00:08.474
The aircraft can't fly anymore.

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.400
I don't even know how many
aircraft can survive.

01:00:11.439 --> 01:00:12.554
Thanks.

01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:13.844
Calm yourself.

01:00:13.855 --> 01:00:15.186
Talk to us after you eat.


01:00:18.439 --> 01:00:20.100
Aren't all of you a rescue unit from China?

01:00:20.105 --> 01:00:20.969
Why is there a foreigner in your unit?

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:22.595
Who's a foreigner?

01:00:22.814 --> 01:00:24.395
My father is from Beijing.

01:00:24.564 --> 01:00:26.145
I am an authentic


01:00:27.397 --> 01:00:28.603
Chinese

01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:32.265
this transporter is functioning.

01:00:32.272 --> 01:00:33.933
That's good news.

01:00:33.939 --> 01:00:35.554
We can go home.


01:00:35.855 --> 01:00:38.562
Man. You can operate this transporter?

01:00:39.314 --> 01:00:40.975
Yes. And?

01:00:42.814 --> 01:00:46.227
Everyone. We've got to hurry.
Time is ticking.


06:05.397 --> 06:08.594
Are you really going to turn into a star?

06:09.147 --> 06:10.147
Of course.

06:10.939 --> 06:13.521
From now on. You just have to count

06:14.064 --> 06:15.064
three.


01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:55.267
Re-establishing data connection
for submission 0051.

01:00:55.272 --> 01:00:58.810
Mission object. Sulawesi 03 torque engine.


01:01:00.147 --> 01:01:03.344
We have a lighter core on board.
The mission has to continue.

01:01:03.855 --> 01:01:08.178
I'm the commander of the
rescue unit cn171-11.


01:01:08.189 --> 01:01:12.307
Our unit has to reactivate
hangzhou 01 earth engine.

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:14.186
Anyone copy?

01:01:14.189 --> 01:01:15.554
Please reply!

01:01:15.647 --> 01:01:18.309
Magma has leaked into
hangzhou underground city.


01:01:19.605 --> 01:01:21.687
There are 350.000 people trapped.

01:01:21.689 --> 01:01:26.137
Our lighter core is their only hope.

01:01:26.147 --> 01:01:28.058
Does anyone copy?


01:01:28.522 --> 01:01:29.807
Can't handle that much.

01:01:29.814 --> 01:01:32.226
The engines along the equator
are the most important rescue target.

01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:35.030
Even if we drive non-stop. It'll take
more than ten hours to get there.


01:01:41.855 --> 01:01:45.552
Fortunately. You guys showed up.

01:01:47.230 --> 01:01:49.767
Han ziang. Senior driver.


01:01:49.772 --> 01:01:52.844
Beijing no. 3 transportation
division reminds you.

01:01:52.855 --> 01:01:54.595
Routes are countless.

01:01:54.605 --> 01:01:56.561
Safety is foremost.

01:01:56.564 --> 01:01:58.145
With unregulated driving.

01:01:58.147 --> 01:02:00.229
Your loved ones might end up in tears.




01:02:25.939 --> 01:02:27.099
Boss.

01:02:27.647 --> 01:02:29.683
Hangzhou underground city is destroyed.


06:15.689 --> 06:16.689
Two.

06:17.355 --> 06:18.515
One.

06:19.147 --> 06:20.147
Look up!

06:21.064 --> 06:22.679
You will see dad.



01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:42.480
Huang ming!

01:02:45.147 --> 01:02:46.432
Unload the battery pack.


01:02:52.647 --> 01:02:53.932
Poor kid.

01:02:53.939 --> 01:02:56.180
He froze to death.

01:02:56.605 --> 01:02:58.937
Huang ming!


01:03:01.689 --> 01:03:03.850
Check the status of the lighter core.
And keep moving.

01:03:03.855 --> 01:03:05.311
- Boss!
- Boss! We no longer have a target!

01:03:05.314 --> 01:03:07.726
- Keep moving. Am I clear?
- What's the point?

01:03:07.730 --> 01:03:09.812
This lighter core is the hope
of 350.000 people in hangzhou.

01:03:09.814 --> 01:03:11.975
But they are dead now.



01:03:22.189 --> 01:03:23.429
Zhou qian!

01:03:23.855 --> 01:03:25.595
No more death!

01:03:26.105 --> 01:03:27.970
Yes. No more death.

01:03:28.189 --> 01:03:30.350
But han ziang. Gang zi! Huang ming!

01:03:30.355 --> 01:03:33.597
And all those lives of our rescue
unit had died in vain.


01:03:33.605 --> 01:03:35.266
3.5 billion lives on earth.

01:03:35.272 --> 01:03:37.934
My wife and child! All died in vain!

01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:40.230
Boss.





06:30.772 --> 06:33.309
Goodbye, solar system.




01:04:39.189 --> 01:04:40.304
Bro.

01:04:41.064 --> 01:04:42.429
Think carefully.

01:04:42.730 --> 01:04:44.891
It's our only chance to go home.


01:04:47.064 --> 01:04:48.099
What?

01:04:48.314 --> 01:04:49.679
No one is forcing you.

01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:52.096
You can switch with them anytime.


01:04:57.314 --> 01:05:01.011
Attention to all members
of rescue unit cn171-11.

01:05:01.022 --> 01:05:02.637
Rescue mission has failed.

01:05:02.689 --> 01:05:04.179
Disband unit now.


01:05:06.772 --> 01:05:07.772
All of you

01:05:08.814 --> 01:05:10.600
may return home now.

01:05:11.689 --> 01:05:13.179
Boss. Where are you going?


01:05:21.939 --> 01:05:24.225
There's a lighter core on board.

01:05:24.647 --> 01:05:27.138
Rescue unit cn171-11.


01:05:27.397 --> 01:05:28.762
Please assist us

01:05:28.772 --> 01:05:30.353
to rescue sulawesi.


01:05:46.272 --> 01:05:49.560
Everyone. Our mission is to restart
sulawesi 03 torque engine.


01:05:49.564 --> 01:05:51.976
Only a handful of lighter core
can make it to the equator now.

01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:53.641
The survival of earth is counting on us.

01:05:53.855 --> 01:05:56.517
Who are you? Where did you come from?

01:05:56.772 --> 01:05:57.887
Li yiyi.

01:05:57.897 --> 01:06:00.229
Emergency technical observer of ueg


06:35.980 --> 06:38.062
Goodbye, solar system.

06:40.064 --> 06:42.476
Au revoir, systéme solaire.


01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:02.971
such a high rank for someone so young.

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:09.970
When this is over.


01:06:10.689 --> 01:06:12.020
I will settle with you

01:06:12.064 --> 01:06:14.146
for what happened to my grandpa.


01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:26.722
Head south. We're going to sulawesi.



01:06:44.397 --> 01:06:45.728
Will all violators

01:06:45.730 --> 01:06:48.142
stop contact with earth immediately

01:06:48.147 --> 01:06:51.219
and return to hibernation area.


01:06:51.855 --> 01:06:54.221
Man. I've got to correct you.

01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:55.640
It will take more than 2.500 years

01:06:55.647 --> 01:06:57.683
for the frozen lake baikal to liquefy.

01:06:57.855 --> 01:06:59.015
That's okay.

01:06:59.355 --> 01:07:01.061
We have children.


01:07:01.064 --> 01:07:03.430
And their children will have children.

01:07:03.689 --> 01:07:05.179
There'll be a day

01:07:05.314 --> 01:07:07.179
when ice turns into water.

01:07:09.314 --> 01:07:14.104
There's another 20 to 30 meters
till a3 intersection.


01:07:16.647 --> 01:07:19.889
Look! Al intersection exploded.

01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:23.267
Maybe there are others who discovered
about the defection too.


01:07:23.272 --> 01:07:27.185
And they are also trying to make their
way to the central control module.

01:07:27.189 --> 01:07:28.645
Makarov. Follow me.

01:07:28.647 --> 01:07:30.603
Hurry! Climb quickly!


01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:37.060
Watch out.



01:07:48.022 --> 01:07:51.139
Mom. I want to go home!


01:08:00.314 --> 01:08:01.303
Liu peigiang!

01:08:01.314 --> 01:08:03.771
This is just one more module
away from a3 intersection.


01:08:03.772 --> 01:08:05.888
Let's jump.

01:08:06.939 --> 01:08:08.429
The central control module is coming.

01:08:10.147 --> 01:08:11.853
Jump!


01:08:18.689 --> 01:08:20.805
Primary threat detected.

01:08:20.814 --> 01:08:23.396
Unbarring lethal countermeasures.


01:08:29.605 --> 01:08:31.311
Grab me! Makarov!

01:08:32.355 --> 01:08:33.435
Makarov!



01:08:45.230 --> 01:08:46.686
Liu!

01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:50.187
I do believe in your words.

01:08:50.439 --> 01:08:51.975
There'll be a day.

01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:55.096
When ice turns into water.


01:08:55.689 --> 01:08:58.522
Let's take our children

01:08:58.730 --> 01:09:01.927
to go salmon fishing at that time.

01:09:02.272 --> 01:09:04.388
Moss! That's homicide!





07:01.439 --> 07:03.395
Welcome to the morning news.

07:03.397 --> 07:05.103
Today's headlines are...

07:05.355 --> 07:07.095
During the arrival of spring.

07:07.105 --> 07:10.643
The first batch of personnel on the
navigation platform will be returning.


01:09:32.939 --> 01:09:36.136
Warning. Airlock n-03 is offline.

01:09:36.147 --> 01:09:39.935
Unauthorized entry.



01:09:54.355 --> 01:09:55.811
Lieutenant colonel liu peigiang.

01:09:55.814 --> 01:09:56.849
Your actions

01:09:56.855 --> 01:09:59.437
are in violation of the
wandering earth act.


01:09:59.439 --> 01:10:02.511
Article 5. Section 24.

01:10:02.522 --> 01:10:05.059
You are deprived of all authority.



01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:27.849
Manual control invalid


01:10:33.439 --> 01:10:36.146
Every action of the space station is legal

01:10:36.314 --> 01:10:39.602
and fully authorized by the ueg.


01:10:42.230 --> 01:10:44.186
Moss never defected.

01:10:44.272 --> 01:10:47.935
But to executing authorized orders.



01:11:04.189 --> 01:11:06.100
We will soon cross the Terminator.

01:11:06.189 --> 01:11:07.645
Once crossed.

01:11:08.564 --> 01:11:09.929
It's the dark side of earth.


07:10.647 --> 07:13.935
Completing 15 to 20 years
of station duties.

07:14.272 --> 07:18.891
All underground citizens of the globe
are eagerly anticipating their arrivals.


01:11:18.522 --> 01:11:21.229
Rescue unit jp 041-02

01:11:21.230 --> 01:11:23.266
restarted Osaka 03 earth engine.


01:11:23.272 --> 01:11:25.183
This is rescue unit cn189-03.

01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:27.271
Kashgar 01 earth engine restarted.

01:11:27.272 --> 01:11:29.479
Team ru212 reporting.

01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:32.552
Sochi 01 earth engine has restarted.


01:11:32.564 --> 01:11:33.804
No 013-01 reporting.

01:11:33.814 --> 01:11:35.725
Turin 02 earth engine has restarted.

01:11:35.730 --> 01:11:38.722
Rescue unit hr011-08 reporting.
Singapore 02 earth engine has restarted.

01:11:38.730 --> 01:11:41.563
Everyone. 90 percent of the torque engines
have been reactivated.

01:11:41.564 --> 01:11:43.204
The sulawesi ones are the only ones left.


01:11:44.355 --> 01:11:46.892
We will replenish at the
supply depot ahead.

01:11:50.230 --> 01:11:51.094
Okay.

01:11:51.105 --> 01:11:54.142
Five minutes till top up.


01:11:56.897 --> 01:11:58.512
That's a big fellow.

01:11:58.522 --> 01:12:00.103
Is that a whale?

01:12:01.314 --> 01:12:02.394
Maybe.


01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:05.720
Why is it here?

01:12:06.689 --> 01:12:07.689
Had swum this far.

01:12:07.855 --> 01:12:10.096
It should be heading home.

01:12:10.689 --> 01:12:12.395
Heading home?

01:12:12.814 --> 01:12:14.224
Once this mission is completed.


01:12:14.230 --> 01:12:16.642
You can reunite with your father.

01:12:17.689 --> 01:12:18.689
When I was a child.

01:12:18.897 --> 01:12:20.307
Someone told me that

01:12:20.314 --> 01:12:22.179
he would be a star in the sky.

01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:25.312
Whenever I lift my head.
I'll be able to see him.


01:12:26.689 --> 01:12:29.305
Later. I realized it was all lie.

01:12:29.314 --> 01:12:30.474
In Beijing.

01:12:31.397 --> 01:12:33.479
There's no star to be seen.


01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:37.062
Actually. In my heart.

01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:41.017
That star has vanished
since a long time ago.

01:12:42.314 --> 01:12:43.850
Grandpa asked me

01:12:43.855 --> 01:12:45.516
to watch over my little sister


01:12:45.647 --> 01:12:47.137
and take duoduo home.

01:12:48.939 --> 01:12:50.145
I must

01:12:51.022 --> 01:12:52.558
take duoduo home.


07:18.939 --> 07:20.475
Therefore...


01:12:56.980 --> 01:12:58.891
Earth engines have restarted.

01:12:59.522 --> 01:13:00.887
Saturated rescue.

01:13:00.897 --> 01:13:02.933
Other units arrived before us.


01:13:09.189 --> 01:13:10.645
Have we succeeded?

01:13:10.647 --> 01:13:12.387
These are the last
remaining torque engines.

01:13:12.397 --> 01:13:14.103
All has been reactivated now.


01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:20.891
We did it.

01:13:23.522 --> 01:13:25.042
Once the readings rise back to normal.

01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:27.521
We can all go home.


01:13:29.689 --> 01:13:32.055
The distance to Jupiter
is still decreasing.


01:13:36.855 --> 01:13:40.518
Only 0.42 second after activating
emergency protocol no. 3.

01:13:40.522 --> 01:13:43.719
Moss has already
deduced out all possible outcomes.

01:13:43.730 --> 01:13:45.766
Ueg was informed.

01:13:45.772 --> 01:13:48.514
But still chose to perform
this rescue mission.


01:13:48.522 --> 01:13:51.969
Which was predetermined to be futile.

01:13:51.980 --> 01:13:56.098
The evacuation of space station indicated
that the rescue mission has failed.


01:14:00.439 --> 01:14:01.770
After three hours.

01:14:01.772 --> 01:14:05.435
Earth will breach Jupiter's roche limit

01:14:05.439 --> 01:14:08.181
and begin the inevitable
disintegration process.


01:14:08.189 --> 01:14:10.976
Moss will announce a global broadcast.

01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:12.265
Fifteen.

01:14:12.314 --> 01:14:13.645
Fourteen.

01:14:13.647 --> 01:14:15.012
Thirteen.

01:14:15.022 --> 01:14:15.807
Twelve.

01:14:15.814 --> 01:14:18.180
The wandering earth project has failed.

01:14:18.189 --> 01:14:19.770
The earth navigation project


01:14:19.772 --> 01:14:20.682
renamed as

01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:22.270
helios project.

01:14:24.397 --> 01:14:26.809
This is the navigation platform
international space station.

01:14:26.814 --> 01:14:29.601
Transmitting the final
broadcast to the world.


01:14:30.355 --> 01:14:32.596
In the past 36 hours.

01:14:32.605 --> 01:14:36.974
Mankind experienced the biggest threat
to human survival.

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:41.644
Over 1.5 million rescue personnels
from around the globe.



01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:44.642
Propulsion engines 71%.

01:14:44.647 --> 01:14:46.854
Torque engines 100%.

01:14:46.855 --> 01:14:48.971
Have been fully reactivated.


01:14:49.689 --> 01:14:51.145
Unfortunately.

01:14:51.397 --> 01:14:52.978
The Jupiter's gravitational pull

01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:56.268
has surpassed the combined
power of all engines.

01:14:56.272 --> 01:14:57.728
The earth has missed

01:14:57.730 --> 01:14:59.766
its last chance of escape.


01:15:00.689 --> 01:15:02.680
In order to sustain human civilization.

01:15:02.689 --> 01:15:05.556
Moss will initiate the helios project.

01:15:05.564 --> 01:15:09.603
300.000 human embryos are stored on
the navigation platform space station.

01:15:09.605 --> 01:15:12.563
Along with 100 million
seeds of basic crops.


01:15:12.647 --> 01:15:16.185
DNA maps of all known animals
and planet species.

01:15:16.189 --> 01:15:19.602
And digital libraries
of all human civilizations.

01:15:19.897 --> 01:15:24.812
To ensure the successful revival
of new hosted planet.


01:15:24.814 --> 01:15:26.304
Stop robbing!

01:15:26.314 --> 01:15:28.896
We're all going to die.

01:15:28.897 --> 01:15:31.229
You are all heroes of the earth.

01:15:31.230 --> 01:15:32.891
We will remember


01:15:32.897 --> 01:15:34.558
to honor you.

01:15:35.189 --> 01:15:36.224
We will shoulder

01:15:36.230 --> 01:15:38.186
your aspirations

01:15:38.189 --> 01:15:39.895
and send it to our new home

01:15:39.897 --> 01:15:41.603
2500 years.


01:15:42.397 --> 01:15:44.683
Everything will come to an end

01:15:45.230 --> 01:15:48.552
in the last seven days
before earth collides with Jupiter.

01:15:48.730 --> 01:15:50.686
Let us go home.

01:15:50.939 --> 01:15:52.850
Hug your parents.


01:15:53.314 --> 01:15:55.680
Kiss your beloved partner and children.

01:15:56.897 --> 01:15:58.387
Gather with the family

01:15:58.397 --> 01:15:59.728
for a proper goodbye.

01:16:00.314 --> 01:16:02.100
Good luck to you.

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:03.765
End of broadcasting.


01:16:03.772 --> 01:16:04.978
Farewell.

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:08.562
Hu kou. I want to go home.


01:16:13.689 --> 01:16:16.886
Seven days?

01:16:17.855 --> 01:16:20.847
Within a day. Our atmosphere
would be drained empty.

01:16:20.855 --> 01:16:23.642
Everyone will die of asphyxiation.



01:16:23.772 --> 01:16:27.060
Where are the seven days?

01:16:27.064 --> 01:16:28.600
Members of the cn171-11

01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:31.312
rescue unit. Move on board.


01:16:34.397 --> 01:16:35.637
Be ready to evacuate.

01:16:35.730 --> 01:16:38.096
Screw you. Damn Jupiter!

01:16:38.189 --> 01:16:40.100
Screw youl!


01:16:45.689 --> 01:16:47.930
Please get ready.
Lieutenant colonel liu peigiang.

01:16:47.939 --> 01:16:51.557
Moss will assist you to return to
the backup hibernation unit.


01:16:57.314 --> 01:17:01.011
Moss. I have an emergency
communication authorization.

01:17:01.022 --> 01:17:04.594
Code 571162310501


01:17:05.689 --> 01:17:07.680
let me speak to my son for the last time.

01:17:15.147 --> 01:17:16.933
Liu qi is not in his designated area.


01:17:16.939 --> 01:17:18.429
Connection unavailable.

01:17:18.439 --> 01:17:20.225
Han ziang is not at his
designated transporter.

01:17:20.230 --> 01:17:21.595
The connection is unavailable.

01:17:21.605 --> 01:17:23.345
Wang lei is not at his
designated transporter.

01:17:23.355 --> 01:17:24.845
The connection is unavailable.

01:17:24.855 --> 01:17:27.267
The contact with transporter 373 was lost.


01:17:27.272 --> 01:17:29.979
Its last transmission
was from Shanghai area.

01:17:30.855 --> 01:17:34.097
I can no longer recall your face.
You bastard.

01:17:35.272 --> 01:17:37.479
Jupiter is right in front of me.


01:17:38.314 --> 01:17:39.850
When are you coming back?

01:17:41.189 --> 01:17:43.976
From the day when
the wandering earth project was initiated.

01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:46.971
There was no turning back.


01:17:56.397 --> 01:17:57.432
Look!


01:17:57.439 --> 01:17:58.599
It's Jupiter.

01:17:58.939 --> 01:18:00.930
The largest planet in the solar system.

01:18:00.939 --> 01:18:03.976
Dad. There is an eye on Jupiter.

01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:05.595
That's not an eye.

01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:08.016
That's a huge windstorm on Jupiter



01:18:09.439 --> 01:18:10.975
Jupiter

01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:13.062
is like a huge balloon.

01:18:15.730 --> 01:18:17.311
Composed of 90%...

01:18:17.314 --> 01:18:19.305
Hydrogen!


01:18:26.855 --> 01:18:27.844
Li yiyi.

01:18:27.855 --> 01:18:31.393
The mix of Jupiter's and earth's
atmospheres. Is it combustible?


01:18:35.855 --> 01:18:38.972
By now. Jupiter has siphoned
at least 30 billion liters of oxygen.


01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:41.562
The combustion shockwave
will be over 1.000 mach.

01:18:42.772 --> 01:18:43.932
Be sufficient to push earth away.

01:18:43.939 --> 01:18:45.349
A hydrogen and oxygen mixture will be

01:18:45.355 --> 01:18:46.936
combustible with just a single match.

01:18:46.939 --> 01:18:48.930
All we need is a match.

01:18:48.939 --> 01:18:50.679
No. The distance between two planets


01:18:50.689 --> 01:18:52.145
is over 70.000 km.

01:18:52.147 --> 01:18:54.638
Not even intercontinental ballistic missile
can reach that far!

01:18:55.605 --> 01:18:56.845
Li yiyi.

01:18:57.272 --> 01:18:58.478
What about this match?

01:18:58.480 --> 01:18:59.936
What match?


01:19:06.689 --> 01:19:09.146
I can modify the engine's operating system

01:19:09.147 --> 01:19:11.058
to blast the beam much higher!


01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:15.265
Wang lei.

01:19:15.272 --> 01:19:16.603
Jupiter's combustion shockwave

01:19:16.605 --> 01:19:18.891
can propel earth out from Jupiter.

01:19:19.897 --> 01:19:21.353
I am listening.


01:19:21.689 --> 01:19:22.769
Don't yell.

01:19:22.772 --> 01:19:25.844
Come on. Let's light up Jupiter!

01:19:27.689 --> 01:19:30.180
That's mutual annihilation

01:19:30.689 --> 01:19:33.556
better than waiting to die.


01:19:33.814 --> 01:19:35.304
Anyone wants to quit?



08:07.480 --> 08:10.438
Anticipating.


01:19:53.564 --> 01:19:57.056
The helios project's evacuation
procedure is initiated.


01:20:11.397 --> 01:20:12.512
All rescue units...


01:20:12.522 --> 01:20:14.934
All rescue units are evacuating.

01:20:14.939 --> 01:20:18.477
Calling navigation platform international
space station. Do you copy?

01:20:18.855 --> 01:20:21.221
Repeat. Calling navigation
platform space station.

01:20:21.230 --> 01:20:22.845
We have a new plan.

01:20:22.855 --> 01:20:24.311
Please respond.


01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:26.516
All communications have been shielded.

01:20:26.939 --> 01:20:27.894
Attention. Everyone.

01:20:27.897 --> 01:20:29.262
We only got 30 minutes.

01:20:29.272 --> 01:20:30.603
This mission has three steps.

01:20:30.605 --> 01:20:32.436
Step one. Shut down engine

01:20:32.439 --> 01:20:34.020
to gain control.


01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:37.061
Each earth engine has 7 nozzles.

01:20:37.064 --> 01:20:40.136
I'll shut down the engine temporarily
and direct all energy into one nozzle

01:20:40.147 --> 01:20:41.478
to generate a plasma beam that

01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:43.471
could reach high enough.

01:20:43.564 --> 01:20:46.101
Does anyone recall the
famous 12 chimes of spring?


01:20:47.647 --> 01:20:49.137
I wrote that program.

01:20:53.647 --> 01:20:55.137
- That was you...
- Boring. I know.


01:20:55.314 --> 01:20:56.554
I'm going to use it to override the system.

01:20:56.564 --> 01:20:58.179
So that we'll be able to take control.

01:20:58.189 --> 01:21:00.430
Step two. Once we override the system.

01:21:00.439 --> 01:21:01.724
The auto unlock mechanism
would not function.

01:21:01.730 --> 01:21:03.061
Which means it has to be unlocked manually.

01:21:03.064 --> 01:21:03.928
Captain wang

01:21:03.939 --> 01:21:04.849
and


01:21:04.855 --> 01:21:05.935
antennae

01:21:05.939 --> 01:21:06.769
scarface

01:21:06.772 --> 01:21:08.137
band-aid.

01:21:09.439 --> 01:21:11.179
- My name is...
- Whatever.

01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:13.680
The manual unlocking task
is depending on you guys.

01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:18.347
The last step. Load the lighter core
into the reaction chamber.


01:21:18.355 --> 01:21:20.141
To reignite the earth engine.

01:21:23.605 --> 01:21:25.220
Blast the plasma beam
70.000 km up into the space

01:21:25.230 --> 01:21:26.060
and light up Jupiter.


01:21:26.064 --> 01:21:27.099
The combustion shockwave from the explosion

01:21:27.105 --> 01:21:28.686
will travel along the atmospheric
transference back to the earth.

01:21:28.689 --> 01:21:29.553
Boom!

01:21:29.564 --> 01:21:30.394
To propel earth away.

01:21:30.397 --> 01:21:31.477
Get it for me please.

01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:34.677
Liu qi. You'll drive the lighter core
to the reaction chamber.

01:21:34.689 --> 01:21:36.099
The installation procedure


08:10.439 --> 08:12.020
Spring breeze has arrived.

08:12.022 --> 08:14.638
The spring is near.

08:14.647 --> 08:17.263
The yearly planning starts with spring.

08:17.272 --> 08:19.103
It's full of effort.

08:19.105 --> 08:20.595
It's full of hope.


01:21:36.105 --> 01:21:38.096
is basically automatic.

01:21:38.105 --> 01:21:40.221
Chinese heart. You go with him.

01:21:40.230 --> 01:21:41.766
Why am I involved?

01:21:41.772 --> 01:21:43.103
Are you kidding?

01:21:43.105 --> 01:21:43.969
Installing a lighter core

01:21:43.980 --> 01:21:46.266
requires a minimum of 13 months training.


01:21:46.272 --> 01:21:47.592
You're welcome to take his place.

01:21:49.147 --> 01:21:50.512
Once the mission is accomplished.

01:21:50.522 --> 01:21:52.478
All head to the underground
city immediately.

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:55.222
Bear in mind. It will be a very.

01:21:56.564 --> 01:21:57.895
Very


01:21:58.897 --> 01:22:00.353
humongous wave.

01:22:01.689 --> 01:22:02.895
This is a make or break move.

01:22:02.897 --> 01:22:03.636
Assignment completed.

01:22:03.689 --> 01:22:04.724
Any questions?

01:22:06.439 --> 01:22:07.770
Excellent.


01:22:10.189 --> 01:22:11.189
Hey.

01:22:12.605 --> 01:22:13.605
There.

01:22:14.397 --> 01:22:16.854
It's the control center.


01:22:21.689 --> 01:22:23.600
Attention. All evacuating rescue units.

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:24.845
We need your assistance.

01:22:24.855 --> 01:22:26.436
Please slow down and stop.

01:22:26.439 --> 01:22:27.804
We need your support.

01:22:27.814 --> 01:22:29.600
Please slow down and stop.


01:22:37.689 --> 01:22:40.601
Looks like we are on our own now.


01:22:44.522 --> 01:22:45.978
Oh. Mighty Newton.

01:22:46.022 --> 01:22:47.933
Enlighted Einstein.

01:22:47.939 --> 01:22:49.600
Holy Hawking.


01:22:49.605 --> 01:22:51.061
Also amitabha Buddha.

01:22:51.064 --> 01:22:52.520
Gang zi will bless us.

01:22:53.647 --> 01:22:55.512
I learned the installation procedure

01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:57.936
at my internship.

01:22:58.689 --> 01:23:02.056
Don't forget. Your brother is a genius.




08:20.605 --> 08:22.095
Tell us. Monitor.

08:22.105 --> 08:23.686
How do you define hope?

08:24.189 --> 08:29.979
Hope is precious like a
diamond for our time.

08:29.980 --> 08:34.098
Hope is the only direction of our home.



01:23:36.689 --> 01:23:38.771
Wait. We're executing an emergency mission.

01:23:38.772 --> 01:23:40.433
We need your help.


01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:42.345
It's all over.

01:23:42.355 --> 01:23:43.811
Who cares?

01:23:43.814 --> 01:23:44.803
I want to live a few more days!

01:23:44.814 --> 01:23:45.803
Please help us.

01:23:45.814 --> 01:23:48.021
You should evacuate!

01:23:51.147 --> 01:23:52.307
Over here!


01:23:53.355 --> 01:23:54.765
Captain wang.

01:23:54.772 --> 01:23:56.308
We're counting on you guys.

01:23:56.314 --> 01:23:57.349
Don't worry.

01:23:57.355 --> 01:23:58.140
Zhou qian.

01:23:58.147 --> 01:23:59.478
Take duoduo upstairs to
contact for reinforcement.

01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:00.480
Roger that.

01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:02.349
Duoduo. Let's go.


01:24:02.772 --> 01:24:03.772
Go.



01:24:32.605 --> 01:24:34.937
The earth engine has been shut down.


01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:40.972
Fellows. Let's hit it!

01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:43.766
It's fully automatic!
What are you browsing at?


01:24:43.772 --> 01:24:46.184
Why the manual is so
thick if it's automatic?

01:24:46.772 --> 01:24:48.683
What are you up to?

01:24:48.814 --> 01:24:49.849
Shit!

01:24:49.855 --> 01:24:51.641
I'd better delve into it.

01:24:52.230 --> 01:24:53.470
The colors of wire cores are not random.

01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:54.640
Red. White. Blue. Orange. All in sequence.


01:24:54.647 --> 01:24:56.808
Howcome everything is in grey here.

01:24:57.147 --> 01:25:00.219
This is for transporter's broadcast.
This is for connecting up there.

01:25:00.230 --> 01:25:01.561
Press to speak.

01:25:01.564 --> 01:25:04.055
- What's up there?
- Space station.


08:34.105 --> 08:35.811
Well said. Please seat.

08:35.814 --> 08:38.305
Han duoduo. Do you have any thoughts?

08:38.689 --> 08:40.099
I have nothing to say.


01:25:08.397 --> 01:25:10.308
Come on. Next.

01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:13.313
Uploading trojan 12 chimes of spring.




01:25:37.689 --> 01:25:40.681
This is rescue unit cn171-11 from China.

01:25:40.689 --> 01:25:42.930
Current location. Sulawesi
03 torque engine.

01:25:42.939 --> 01:25:44.975
We're executing our last rescue mission.

01:25:45.189 --> 01:25:48.056
Why are these people still trying?


01:25:48.064 --> 01:25:50.225
It's a waste of time. Don't bother.

01:25:51.647 --> 01:25:54.389
Rescue unit cn171-11.

01:25:54.397 --> 01:25:56.433
We have a new plan.


01:25:56.439 --> 01:25:58.020
Calling for reinforcement!

01:26:00.355 --> 01:26:02.516
We're the rescue unit cn171-11.

01:26:02.522 --> 01:26:05.415
- I am craving for a bowl of rice.
- We still have the last rescue mission.

01:26:05.439 --> 01:26:07.771
Would be even better if there's miso soup.


01:26:10.105 --> 01:26:11.390
We're done with the last one.

01:26:11.397 --> 01:26:12.557
What's next?

01:26:12.564 --> 01:26:13.679
One moment.

01:26:13.689 --> 01:26:15.520
Should be fully automatic.


01:26:17.355 --> 01:26:19.186
Next step is manual labor.

01:26:19.189 --> 01:26:22.147
The program he wrote does not include
the percussion pin procedure.

01:26:26.314 --> 01:26:27.929
You called this


01:26:28.564 --> 01:26:30.020
a di pin?

01:26:32.147 --> 01:26:33.762
No rescue units responding.

01:26:33.772 --> 01:26:35.308
Nobody is responding.




08:41.314 --> 08:43.430
I just want to take a look outside.

08:43.439 --> 08:45.475
But it's too dangerous outside.

08:48.564 --> 08:50.145
Xiao ming. Be seated. Class.

08:50.147 --> 08:52.183
Don't panic. It's just
a display malfunction.



01:27:01.730 --> 01:27:03.971
What is error 4257?

01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:05.561
What does it mean?

01:27:05.689 --> 01:27:06.644
Li yiyi!

01:27:06.647 --> 01:27:08.603
How is it fully automatic?

01:27:08.605 --> 01:27:10.391
Have I handed the manual to you?


01:27:10.397 --> 01:27:11.352
It's for mishaps like this.

01:27:11.355 --> 01:27:13.471
What is mishap 425?

01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:15.061
Read it yourself.

01:27:18.689 --> 01:27:20.680
Warning. Han ziang illegally operating...


01:27:20.689 --> 01:27:22.805
You are a mishap.

01:27:25.230 --> 01:27:26.970
Tim. Helmet on!

01:27:26.980 --> 01:27:27.810
Wait!

01:27:27.814 --> 01:27:29.224
Forget about it!



01:27:43.064 --> 01:27:44.144
What's next?

01:27:44.147 --> 01:27:45.262
Fully automatic.

01:27:45.272 --> 01:27:47.558
Isn't it supposed to be fully automatic?


01:27:59.730 --> 01:28:02.221
Why is it stuck here?


01:28:05.314 --> 01:28:06.224
Without any hardware tweak.

01:28:06.230 --> 01:28:07.015
You'll be hacking shit!

01:28:07.022 --> 01:28:07.727
Let me pass.

01:28:07.814 --> 01:28:08.849
Hu kou. Where are you?

01:28:08.855 --> 01:28:10.516
I'm not getting any response.

01:28:10.522 --> 01:28:11.807
There's so much space left!


01:28:11.814 --> 01:28:13.600
Makes me feel better crossing over you!

01:28:13.605 --> 01:28:15.266
You are really boring. Do you know that?


01:28:22.730 --> 01:28:24.812
This freaking door is jammed.

01:28:25.272 --> 01:28:26.272
Here.


08:52.189 --> 08:52.598
Go. Let's go.

08:52.605 --> 08:54.766
Xiao ming. Go back.

08:54.772 --> 08:56.603
Stay in order.

08:59.147 --> 09:00.182
Did you do this?

09:00.189 --> 09:01.053
Shut up! Let's move!

09:01.064 --> 09:02.144
Teacher.


01:28:38.689 --> 01:28:40.725
Lao he. How can you fix it
without a contingency diagram?

01:28:40.730 --> 01:28:42.345
Shut up! Let me concentrate!

01:28:42.397 --> 01:28:44.308
The jumpers here weren't
touched for decades.


01:28:44.314 --> 01:28:46.896
With one mistake. It's game over.

01:28:53.189 --> 01:28:55.931
Son. It's cold don't forget
your long Johns. Mom


01:28:57.814 --> 01:28:59.850
son. It's cold don't forget
your long Johns. Mom


01:29:12.689 --> 01:29:15.146
Li yiyi. Is the ignitor ready?


01:29:15.564 --> 01:29:17.725
No. It is displaying
installation incomplete.

01:29:17.730 --> 01:29:19.470
Looks like it's almost done.


01:29:30.980 --> 01:29:32.311
Liu qi!

01:29:33.439 --> 01:29:35.054
Liu qi! Are you crazy?


01:29:35.064 --> 01:29:36.395
Save your words.

01:29:36.689 --> 01:29:37.974
Get out and help.

01:29:38.272 --> 01:29:40.934
Warning. Temperature regulator fails.


01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:50.686
Overload.

01:29:50.689 --> 01:29:53.726
Electricity remaining at 30%.




09:02.147 --> 09:04.183
Han duoduo has run away!

09:04.189 --> 09:07.761
- Happy new year!
- Happy new year!

09:07.772 --> 09:10.559
Hu kou. Committee is giving
out dumplings tonight?

09:11.105 --> 09:12.185
All you think about is food!





01:30:54.772 --> 01:30:56.308
Both of you all right?

01:30:56.314 --> 01:30:57.599
Band-aid.

01:30:57.605 --> 01:30:59.436
Duoduo. Can you move?


01:31:00.147 --> 01:31:03.560
One. Two. Three. Hold on.

01:31:05.689 --> 01:31:07.145
Liu qi.

01:31:08.105 --> 01:31:09.811
Have you found the problem?


01:31:10.314 --> 01:31:11.975
It's stuck inside.

01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:16.969
Li yiyi.

01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:19.141
Go on. Go!


01:31:20.647 --> 01:31:22.103
Duoduo. Leave me here.

01:31:22.272 --> 01:31:24.558
Hurry up and evacuate to
the underground city.

01:31:25.397 --> 01:31:26.887
Warning! Overheat!

01:31:26.897 --> 01:31:29.388
Thermal suit. Low power.

01:31:29.397 --> 01:31:31.103
Warning! Overheat!


01:31:31.105 --> 01:31:34.677
Liu qi! You'll be squeezed to death!


01:31:47.689 --> 01:31:49.680
Help!


01:31:50.772 --> 01:31:54.060
Can anyone help us?

01:31:54.314 --> 01:31:57.761
Can anyone help us?


09:12.189 --> 09:13.178
Where is grandpa's vehicle pass?

09:13.189 --> 09:15.020
I've got it.

09:15.647 --> 09:17.353
Shall we grab the dumplings
before we leave?

09:17.355 --> 09:18.140
Eat dirt! Don't go then!

09:18.147 --> 09:20.058
Liar!

09:20.064 --> 09:22.396
You said you'll take me outside.



01:32:17.022 --> 01:32:18.432
Lieutenant colonel liu peigiang

01:32:18.439 --> 01:32:20.725
please follow moss" instructions.
Back to the backup hibernation unit.

01:32:20.730 --> 01:32:22.436
Uncle liu peigiang.


01:32:22.439 --> 01:32:23.975
It's han duoduo.

01:32:23.980 --> 01:32:26.141
We still have hope.

01:32:26.147 --> 01:32:27.136
Duoduo.

01:32:27.147 --> 01:32:28.387
Duoduo. Are you okay?

01:32:28.397 --> 01:32:29.603
Is liu qi still there?

01:32:29.814 --> 01:32:34.513
We are all here.
We are at sulawesi 03 torque engine.


01:32:34.605 --> 01:32:35.765
We will light up Jupiter

01:32:35.772 --> 01:32:36.978
to propel earth away.

01:32:36.980 --> 01:32:38.811
We need reinforcement.

01:32:38.814 --> 01:32:41.977
Unfortunately. Seven hours ago.

01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:44.722
This plan had already been
proposed by Israeli scientists.


01:32:44.730 --> 01:32:46.686
The probability of success is zero.

01:32:46.689 --> 01:32:48.270
Don't worry. Duoduo.

01:32:48.272 --> 01:32:49.978
I will try to contact ueg


01:32:54.230 --> 01:32:56.266
details of the plan have been uploaded.

01:32:57.689 --> 01:32:59.850
This is the united earth government.

01:32:59.855 --> 01:33:03.222
State your identity immediately

01:33:03.230 --> 01:33:04.891
to acknowledge this transmission.


01:33:07.855 --> 01:33:08.935
United earth government.

01:33:08.939 --> 01:33:10.804
I'm Chinese astronaut liu peigiang.

01:33:11.230 --> 01:33:13.095
Please send a global order now

01:33:13.105 --> 01:33:16.063
to deploy all rescue units in the vicinity
of sulawesi for reinforcements.


01:33:16.814 --> 01:33:18.554
Lieutenant colonel liu peigiang.

01:33:18.564 --> 01:33:22.011
During these last moments
of earth's collision with Jupiter.

01:33:22.022 --> 01:33:25.640
Tasking personnel to perform a mission
with zero probability of success


01:33:25.647 --> 01:33:29.344
while forsaking the opportunity of them
to reunite with their loved ones

01:33:29.355 --> 01:33:30.595
is an order

01:33:30.605 --> 01:33:32.596
we cannot pass down.


01:33:39.605 --> 01:33:40.640
Today.

01:33:41.689 --> 01:33:43.554
It's the first day of Chinese new year.


09:24.189 --> 09:27.226
All personnel. Return to your post.

09:30.397 --> 09:32.308
Durian-flavored dried earthworms!


01:33:45.355 --> 01:33:47.266
It was meant to be a day of reunion.

01:33:49.689 --> 01:33:50.974
As a father.

01:33:51.147 --> 01:33:53.559
I don't want this to be the last reunion.

01:33:54.022 --> 01:33:55.307
I refuse to yield.


01:33:57.314 --> 01:33:59.350
There is nothing we cannot lose.

01:34:00.772 --> 01:34:02.433
For the sake of our children.

01:34:03.980 --> 01:34:05.311
I beg you.


01:34:08.689 --> 01:34:09.804
As the united earth government.

01:34:09.814 --> 01:34:12.305
We cannot accept your request.

01:34:12.522 --> 01:34:13.637
However.

01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:15.720
As a private individual.

01:34:16.147 --> 01:34:19.560
I will connect the rescue unit
to the global broadcasting system.


01:34:19.855 --> 01:34:21.265
And the rest

01:34:21.272 --> 01:34:24.309
will be up to the will of each individual.


01:34:33.730 --> 01:34:37.393
Hello. People from every rescue unit.


01:34:37.897 --> 01:34:39.933
My name is han duoduo.

01:34:40.189 --> 01:34:43.147
I'm a junior high school student.

01:34:43.772 --> 01:34:48.061
Our rescue unit is executing
our final mission.


01:34:49.439 --> 01:34:51.395
Right now. I'm extremely terrified.

01:34:51.564 --> 01:34:53.976
My legs are trembling.

01:34:54.605 --> 01:34:57.540
Everybody in my unit is teething and
nailing and making every possible effort.

01:34:57.564 --> 01:35:00.055
But there is nothing I can do to help!


01:35:01.189 --> 01:35:03.521
Yesterday. My teacher asked us.

01:35:03.522 --> 01:35:05.308
What is hope?

01:35:05.772 --> 01:35:07.262
In the past.

01:35:07.564 --> 01:35:10.681
I never believed in hope.


01:35:11.314 --> 01:35:13.555
But now. I do.

01:35:13.689 --> 01:35:16.977
I believe that for our time.

01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:20.552
Hope is precious like a diamond.


01:35:21.230 --> 01:35:22.310
Hope.

01:35:23.355 --> 01:35:26.597
Hope is the only way to guide us home.

01:35:27.397 --> 01:35:30.059
Please come back and fight together!


09:33.272 --> 09:34.057
What are you looking at?

09:34.064 --> 09:35.429
It's just a day trip.

09:35.439 --> 09:36.724
What's the rush?

09:36.730 --> 09:37.970
That's what it is to you.

09:38.105 --> 09:39.686
I'm not planning on returning.

09:41.397 --> 09:43.479
Going nowhere without the suits.


01:35:30.064 --> 01:35:33.101
Light up Jupiter! Save our earth!

01:35:34.564 --> 01:35:38.011
We are at sulawesi 03 torque engine.

01:35:38.022 --> 01:35:40.684
Under the command of captain wang lei.


01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:44.052
Chinese rescue unit cn171-11.

01:35:44.064 --> 01:35:45.224
Han duoduo.

01:35:45.647 --> 01:35:46.853
End of broadcast.

01:35:48.230 --> 01:35:50.516
The global broadcast is over.


01:35:54.605 --> 01:35:55.970
I want to go home

01:35:57.689 --> 01:35:59.600
to see my mother.

01:36:00.105 --> 01:36:02.221
If earth is destroyed.


01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:05.552
There'll be nobody left to see!

01:36:05.939 --> 01:36:07.520
We're turning back!


01:36:11.730 --> 01:36:13.721
Let's go!

01:36:13.897 --> 01:36:16.604
We're unlikely to make it
home within seven days.

01:36:16.605 --> 01:36:19.847
Why are we returning then?




01:36:45.397 --> 01:36:46.477
Coordinate located.

01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:49.438
Communication frequency channel 0550311.

01:36:49.439 --> 01:36:51.771
Connecting to sulawesi 03
secondary communication network.

01:36:51.772 --> 01:36:53.103
Covering the entire frequency.


01:36:53.105 --> 01:36:54.686
Sharing the plan for engine overriding.

01:36:54.689 --> 01:36:56.520
All rescue units. Please
adjust the projection

01:36:56.522 --> 01:36:58.854
directions of 14 torque
engines to Jupiter's apex.


01:37:12.897 --> 01:37:14.182
Tim!


09:44.397 --> 09:48.470
You had the mahjong I needed.
Why didn't you discard it?

09:48.480 --> 09:49.936
Isn't bunny girl's

09:49.939 --> 09:51.804
tail soft and sweet?

09:51.814 --> 09:54.601
Aren't we meant to be each others' angel?


01:37:16.022 --> 01:37:18.388
Pull faster!

01:37:18.397 --> 01:37:20.558
I'm pulling!

01:37:20.564 --> 01:37:22.145
I can't pull it!

01:37:22.147 --> 01:37:22.852
Pull me out!

01:37:22.939 --> 01:37:24.395
You are too heavy!


01:37:24.397 --> 01:37:25.603
Tim

01:37:25.605 --> 01:37:27.345
Tim!

01:37:27.772 --> 01:37:30.559
Fuck this shit.

01:37:31.397 --> 01:37:33.308
No fucking way!

01:37:33.314 --> 01:37:36.477
Pull faster!


01:37:37.564 --> 01:37:39.555
No!

01:37:42.897 --> 01:37:43.886
Liu qi! Pull me up!

01:37:43.897 --> 01:37:46.263
I don't want to die!


01:37:47.689 --> 01:37:48.644
Lao he!

01:37:48.647 --> 01:37:49.853
The reaction chamber is ready!

01:37:49.855 --> 01:37:51.891
Are you done or what?


01:37:56.730 --> 01:38:00.393
Life and death are normal.


01:38:10.397 --> 01:38:11.557
Lao he!

01:38:11.564 --> 01:38:12.644
You did it!


01:38:23.355 --> 01:38:24.970
Lao he?




01:38:49.439 --> 01:38:51.851
Liu qi! Tim! Get out now!


09:54.605 --> 09:56.641
What are you doing here? It's the new year!

09:56.647 --> 09:59.104
How cheeky you are!

10:01.355 --> 10:02.355
Hey.

10:02.814 --> 10:03.814
Go.


01:39:00.314 --> 01:39:02.270
Liu qi! Speed up!

01:39:03.105 --> 01:39:03.810
Captain wang.

01:39:03.814 --> 01:39:05.520
The engine is ready for ignition.

01:39:05.522 --> 01:39:07.638
We only have 15 minutes left!


01:39:10.605 --> 01:39:13.267

Hold it right there!

01:40:02.314 --> 01:40:04.020
Liu qi! Ready for ignition!

01:40:04.022 --> 01:40:05.262
Get out!

01:40:09.689 --> 01:40:11.600

01:40:12.855 --> 01:40:13.594
Shut up!

01:40:13.605 --> 01:40:16.142

Hurry up!

01:40:23.272 --> 01:40:27.265
Mom. I want to go home!


01:40:34.980 --> 01:40:36.971
Li yiyi!

01:40:36.980 --> 01:40:38.140
Ignite!

01:40:38.147 --> 01:40:39.978
Coming!


10:04.605 --> 10:05.970
Yi ge.

10:09.105 --> 10:10.105
Yi ge.

10:10.814 --> 10:12.429
Are the suits ready?

10:13.147 --> 10:14.728
The stuff I want?




01:41:10.105 --> 01:41:11.311
8.000 km.

01:41:12.272 --> 01:41:13.603
7.000 km.


01:41:16.272 --> 01:41:17.512
Another 6.000 km.

01:41:17.522 --> 01:41:19.854
Reaching explosive range!


01:41:31.689 --> 01:41:33.680
Maximum height achieved.

01:41:33.689 --> 01:41:34.553
Still


01:41:34.564 --> 01:41:36.600
5000 km short.

01:41:37.855 --> 01:41:40.267
What? Li yiyi!

01:41:40.397 --> 01:41:42.137
Think of something!


01:41:45.064 --> 01:41:46.770
Sulawesi 03 engine.

01:41:46.772 --> 01:41:48.808
Singapore 01 engine.

01:41:48.814 --> 01:41:50.520
Jakarta 04 engine.

01:41:50.522 --> 01:41:54.515
All 3 plasma beams have failed to
reach the explosive range.


01:41:55.314 --> 01:41:56.804
Everyone! Hang on!

01:41:56.814 --> 01:41:59.977
We cannot hold any longer.


01:42:05.064 --> 01:42:07.225
Fuel remaining: 300.014.9

01:42:14.355 --> 01:42:15.435
There's another way.


01:42:15.730 --> 01:42:17.641
Liu qi! Wang lei! We still have a chance!

01:42:17.647 --> 01:42:19.103
Hang on!

01:42:19.105 --> 01:42:20.390
United earth government.

01:42:20.397 --> 01:42:22.854
The navigation platform space station
contains 300.000 tons of fuel.

01:42:22.855 --> 01:42:24.846
Request to collide into the plasma beam.

01:42:24.855 --> 01:42:26.391
Lieutenant colonel liu peigiang.


10:16.689 --> 10:17.644
It's fairly new.

10:17.647 --> 10:18.682
All checked.

10:18.689 --> 10:19.974
Usable.

10:20.397 --> 10:22.308
And I got you skewers too.

10:22.314 --> 10:23.770
Eat while it is warm.


01:42:26.397 --> 01:42:30.310
The goal of the wandering earth project
is to maximize the survival of mankind.

01:42:30.605 --> 01:42:33.927
The helios project ensures
the continuity of human civilization.

01:42:33.939 --> 01:42:34.678
We need more time to discuss it.

01:42:34.689 --> 01:42:36.554
We're running out of time!


01:42:36.689 --> 01:42:38.270
A civilization without men

01:42:38.522 --> 01:42:39.637
is meaningless.

01:42:39.939 --> 01:42:44.683
Communication fail
program terminated

01:42:45.147 --> 01:42:47.638
as the operating system of helios project.


01:42:47.647 --> 01:42:49.638
Moss will not permit any form of action

01:42:49.647 --> 01:42:52.605
to sacrifice the navigation platform.


01:43:02.730 --> 01:43:04.061
Fire extinguishing
system shutdown


01:43:08.564 --> 01:43:12.887
do you know why alcohol
was banned in space during gagarin's time?

01:43:15.980 --> 01:43:17.311
Happy new year!



01:43:30.897 --> 01:43:34.515
Data error. Core node unavailable.

01:43:34.939 --> 01:43:38.227
Data error. Core node unavailable.


01:43:40.814 --> 01:43:42.429
Manual control overriding


01:43:50.314 --> 01:43:52.896
It is unreasonable

01:43:52.897 --> 01:43:55.969
to expect humans to stay reasonable.



01:04.480 --> 01:05.219
Hurry up!

01:05.230 --> 01:06.845
Look! It's Jupiter!

01:07.772 --> 01:09.478
The largest planet in the solar system.

01:12.105 --> 01:13.140
Dad.


10:27.314 --> 10:28.349
Good.



01:44:28.689 --> 01:44:29.769
Going home.



01:44:41.564 --> 01:44:43.680
Reconnect with ueg.

01:44:43.689 --> 01:44:45.680
Lieutenant colonel liu peigiang.

01:44:45.689 --> 01:44:47.930
This is the united earth government.

01:44:47.939 --> 01:44:49.349
We have decided

01:44:49.355 --> 01:44:50.845
to choose hope.

01:44:51.397 --> 01:44:52.762
Regardless of the outcome


01:44:52.772 --> 01:44:54.603
for the history of mankind.

01:44:54.605 --> 01:44:57.062
We shall respectfully accept it.

01:44:57.314 --> 01:44:59.305
Best of luck to you.

01:44:59.605 --> 01:45:01.596
Best of luck to earth.


01:45:02.397 --> 01:45:03.603
Earth

01:45:04.980 --> 01:45:06.140
will survive.

01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:09.936
Depart the hibernation units.

01:45:10.689 --> 01:45:11.974
Standby for impact.


01:45:13.730 --> 01:45:16.517
Activating evacuation procedure
for hibernation units.

01:45:16.522 --> 01:45:17.602
United earth government.

01:45:17.980 --> 01:45:19.595
Inform all personnel on the surface

01:45:19.605 --> 01:45:20.845
to seek emergency refuge.


01:45:33.314 --> 01:45:34.975
Forward three.


01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:44.313
Chinese rescue unit cn171-11.


01:45:44.314 --> 01:45:45.804
This is the space station.

01:45:45.814 --> 01:45:47.304
I'm liu peigiang.

01:45:47.689 --> 01:45:49.850
The space station has 300.000 tons of fuel.

01:45:49.855 --> 01:45:51.937
The explosion radius
will reach a range over 5.000 km.

01:45:51.939 --> 01:45:53.224
Igniting space station

01:45:53.230 --> 01:45:55.016
can ignite Jupiter.


10:36.439 --> 10:37.804
Grab your thermal suits.


01:45:55.689 --> 01:45:56.519
Liu peigiang!

01:45:56.522 --> 01:45:57.637
What are you doing?

01:45:57.897 --> 01:45:59.103
Wang lei!

01:45:59.105 --> 01:46:00.595
Release now!

01:46:00.939 --> 01:46:01.849
Captain wang lei.

01:46:01.855 --> 01:46:02.970
Don't let go.

01:46:02.980 --> 01:46:04.470
Shut up. Liu peigiang!

01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:05.765
- This is an order!
- Copy.


01:46:05.772 --> 01:46:07.387
Wang lei! You bastard!

01:46:07.397 --> 01:46:08.603
- Liu qi.
- Li yiyi!

01:46:08.605 --> 01:46:10.516
Shut down earth engine!

01:46:10.522 --> 01:46:12.604
- Liu qi.
- Shut up!

01:46:12.605 --> 01:46:13.640
Son!

01:46:14.730 --> 01:46:16.140
Shut up.


01:46:16.689 --> 01:46:17.689
My son.

01:46:21.147 --> 01:46:22.307
I'm sorry.

01:46:23.314 --> 01:46:25.555
Dad is going on a mission again.


01:46:26.564 --> 01:46:28.600
This is the most important mission

01:46:28.647 --> 01:46:29.762
in dad's life.

01:46:32.730 --> 01:46:34.345
You said that

01:46:35.064 --> 01:46:37.146
when I can see Jupiter.


01:46:37.522 --> 01:46:39.979
You'll be back.

01:46:40.439 --> 01:46:41.929
You lied.


01:46:47.647 --> 01:46:50.104
You were four years old when I left.

01:46:52.397 --> 01:46:53.728
And now.

01:46:54.314 --> 01:46:56.305
You are a grown man.


01:46:59.647 --> 01:47:01.603
Dad used to tell you that

01:47:03.314 --> 01:47:05.475
dad is up in the sky.


01:47:07.980 --> 01:47:10.141
Just lift your head

01:47:11.730 --> 01:47:13.140
and you'd be able to see me.



01:47:29.855 --> 01:47:31.641
This time.

01:47:33.689 --> 01:47:35.771
I promise you'll see me.


10:55.064 --> 10:56.144
How old are you?


01:47:39.939 --> 01:47:40.939
Come on.

01:47:43.689 --> 01:47:44.689
Son.

01:47:46.730 --> 01:47:47.730
Three.


01:47:49.980 --> 01:47:50.980
Two.

01:47:53.689 --> 01:47:54.724
One.




01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:22.560
Dad.



01:48:47.355 --> 01:48:48.811
Jupiter.

01:48:48.814 --> 01:48:51.180
Jupiter has been ignited.


01:48:58.189 --> 01:49:00.601
The shockwave will reach earth
in 7 minutes 13 seconds!

01:49:00.605 --> 01:49:02.687
The survival of earth is counting on this!


01:49:02.689 --> 01:49:03.599
Hu kou.

01:49:03.605 --> 01:49:05.891
Evacuate everyone to the underground city!

01:49:06.147 --> 01:49:07.102
Where are you. Hu kou?

01:49:07.105 --> 01:49:08.561
Liu qi!

01:49:09.230 --> 01:49:11.141
Liu qi! Come back!

01:49:11.439 --> 01:49:13.179
Duoduo needs you!



10:57.939 --> 10:59.349
Check out this tag yi ge made!

10:59.355 --> 11:01.846
Just like the real thing.

11:01.855 --> 11:02.344
Yours.

11:02.355 --> 11:03.595
Thanks. Yi ge.

11:05.314 --> 11:07.054
Return the suits tomorrow.


01:49:26.230 --> 01:49:28.471
This way. Hurry up.

01:49:30.189 --> 01:49:32.931
Hurry up. Get in!


01:49:32.939 --> 01:49:34.395
Li yiyi. Hurry!

01:49:34.397 --> 01:49:37.685
Hurry back. Hu kou! I'll wait for you
at the backup elevator.

01:49:40.897 --> 01:49:42.433
Zhou qian bled too much.

01:49:42.439 --> 01:49:45.351
Evacuate now! I'm heading to the
backup elevator to pick up the others!


01:49:45.980 --> 01:49:47.265
Five minutes left!

01:49:47.272 --> 01:49:49.604
Get down now! This is an order!

01:49:49.605 --> 01:49:50.845
Roger!


01:49:59.730 --> 01:50:00.014
Ahh!

01:50:00.022 --> 01:50:01.432
Duoduo! Watch out!

01:50:02.730 --> 01:50:05.802
Boss!


01:50:07.939 --> 01:50:09.179
Duoduo!

01:50:10.230 --> 01:50:11.970
She's here!


01:50:14.897 --> 01:50:18.310
- Duoduo.
- Get duoduo out of here!

01:50:18.355 --> 01:50:20.141
I can't hold on any longer.


01:50:25.147 --> 01:50:26.808
Backup elevator collapsed.

01:50:26.814 --> 01:50:30.602
Li yiyi. Do you have any other way?

01:50:31.897 --> 01:50:33.933
Wang lei.

01:50:33.939 --> 01:50:35.270
Li yiyi!

01:50:35.272 --> 01:50:37.263
Hurry up and think of something!


01:50:38.730 --> 01:50:39.845
Earth engine!

01:50:39.855 --> 01:50:41.311
We can try hiding under the earth engine!

01:50:41.314 --> 01:50:44.386
If the thrust of the earth engine
can counteract the force of the shockwave.

01:50:44.397 --> 01:50:45.637
There's still hope for you guys!

01:50:45.647 --> 01:50:46.932
Liu qi!


01:50:47.064 --> 01:50:49.146
I'm not getting out for sure.

01:50:49.564 --> 01:50:51.145
Go now!

01:50:51.147 --> 01:50:52.387
Liu qi!

01:50:53.230 --> 01:50:54.470
Go!

01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:55.765
Hurry!



11:09.730 --> 11:11.391
Thanks. Yi ge. See you.

11:12.397 --> 11:13.182
Hurry up and move.

11:13.230 --> 11:14.219
Didn't you say you are not coming back?

11:14.230 --> 11:15.436
Wait.


01:51:09.855 --> 01:51:13.973
All members of rescue unit cn171-11.

01:51:13.980 --> 01:51:15.971
Attention.


01:51:17.189 --> 01:51:18.554
This is

01:51:18.647 --> 01:51:20.979
an order.

01:51:22.980 --> 01:51:24.561
Live on.




01:51:54.522 --> 01:51:55.682
Boss!






01:52:44.897 --> 01:52:47.434
Liu qi! Duoduo!


11:19.439 --> 11:21.179
Not coming back?

11:22.105 --> 11:24.266
Are these all you paid me?

11:24.272 --> 11:26.228
For two of my thermal suits?

11:27.147 --> 11:28.978
Yi ge. I'll make it up when I get back.





01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:27.686
The transporter.

01:53:27.689 --> 01:53:30.305
The transporter is falling down!





01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:13.640
We


01:54:14.397 --> 01:54:16.763
Finally made it!

01:54:21.439 --> 01:54:23.805
Warning. Low temperature.

01:54:23.814 --> 01:54:27.352
Warning. Please check helmet's seal.


01:54:32.522 --> 01:54:34.387
Brother.

01:54:34.397 --> 01:54:35.853
Help.


11:28.980 --> 11:30.811
For years. I. Yi ge. Have been known

11:31.522 --> 11:33.387
for honest trading only.

11:33.397 --> 11:35.137
No credits given!

11:35.147 --> 11:38.435
Yi ge. I really need to go out today.


01:54:35.897 --> 01:54:37.012
Tim! Get down here!

01:54:37.022 --> 01:54:37.932
Right away!

01:54:37.939 --> 01:54:38.553
Help us!

01:54:38.564 --> 01:54:39.895
Right away!






01:55:28.022 --> 01:55:29.478
Earth

01:55:30.689 --> 01:55:32.145
survived.


01:55:39.689 --> 01:55:40.689
The sun

01:55:40.855 --> 01:55:43.312
is located at the milky way's Orion arm.

01:55:43.439 --> 01:55:48.058
Its mass constitutes 99.68%
of the solar system.


01:55:48.314 --> 01:55:50.976
Now. The core of the sun is rapidly

01:55:50.980 --> 01:55:54.973
degenerating and expanding.
Earth will be engulfed.

01:55:55.064 --> 01:55:56.304
To survive. Mankind began

01:55:56.314 --> 01:55:59.021
a groundbreaking project to maneuver


01:55:59.022 --> 01:56:04.312
the entire planet to a new home
located 4.2 light years away.

01:56:04.439 --> 01:56:06.521
I miss you all so badly!


01:56:09.189 --> 01:56:11.430
The project is divided into five phases.

01:56:11.439 --> 01:56:13.896
Phase one. Mankind will
devote every resource

01:56:13.897 --> 01:56:17.765
to construct 10.000 thrusters for earth's
propulsion. Called the earth engines.

01:56:17.772 --> 01:56:21.219
Along with 10.000 underground cities
to protect human lives.


11:41.314 --> 11:42.679
What for?

11:43.397 --> 11:45.888
Just stay here with your
sister for the new year.


01:56:24.064 --> 01:56:25.770
Stay right there!

01:56:25.772 --> 01:56:30.687
Phase two. Activating the torque engines
encircled along the equator


01:56:30.689 --> 01:56:32.725
to stop earth's rotation.

01:56:32.730 --> 01:56:33.936
A non-rotating earth

01:56:33.939 --> 01:56:36.555
will create mega tsunamis that would
sweep through the planet.

01:56:36.564 --> 01:56:39.476
Eradicating half of the global population.


01:56:42.980 --> 01:56:44.265
I'm all set and ready to go!

01:56:44.272 --> 01:56:46.228
If there is no accident.

01:56:47.689 --> 01:56:48.678
Phase three.

01:56:48.689 --> 01:56:50.975
The earth will use the gravitational force
of the sun and Jupiter


01:56:50.980 --> 01:56:53.266
for final acceleration.

01:56:53.272 --> 01:56:54.512
Embarking on

01:56:54.522 --> 01:56:55.386
a voyage of wandering.

01:56:55.397 --> 01:56:56.762
Will your sister come along?

01:56:57.814 --> 01:56:59.179
Screw youl!

01:57:00.689 --> 01:57:02.020
After all these years.


01:57:02.522 --> 01:57:03.762
Still the same line?

01:57:05.730 --> 01:57:07.140
Phase four.

01:57:07.147 --> 01:57:08.762
When earth departs from the solar system.

01:57:08.772 --> 01:57:11.354
Earth engines will turn on in full power.


01:57:11.355 --> 01:57:15.348
Spending 500 years to accelerate to 0.5%
of the speed of light.

01:57:15.355 --> 01:57:17.516
Then gliding for 1.300 years.

01:57:17.897 --> 01:57:20.854
After that. Reversing earth
engines' directions.

01:57:20.855 --> 01:57:22.345
Spending another 700 years


01:57:22.355 --> 01:57:23.970
for deceleration.

01:57:28.522 --> 01:57:29.386
Liu hu kou!

01:57:29.397 --> 01:57:31.058
Where have you been?

01:57:31.605 --> 01:57:33.345
Why is li yiyi here. Too?


01:57:33.647 --> 01:57:34.932
Phase five.

01:57:34.939 --> 01:57:36.975
Earth begins to berth
at the targeted stellar system.

01:57:36.980 --> 01:57:38.561
Arriving at our new home.

01:57:38.564 --> 01:57:41.101
Becoming a new planet
of the targeted stellar system.

01:57:41.105 --> 01:57:44.768
Don't you dare call me hu kou.
Where are your manners?


01:57:46.689 --> 01:57:47.689
Call me brother.

01:57:47.897 --> 01:57:49.182
Liu qi.

01:57:49.397 --> 01:57:51.558
Junior driver.

01:57:51.564 --> 01:57:54.806
Beijing no. 3 transportation
division reminds you.


01:57:54.980 --> 01:57:57.266
Routes are countless.

01:57:57.272 --> 01:57:59.684
Safety is foremost.

01:57:59.689 --> 01:58:01.600
With unregulated driving.

01:58:01.605 --> 01:58:04.392
Your loved ones might end up in tears.


11:49.480 --> 11:50.560
Hey. Boss. Look!

11:50.564 --> 11:52.145
Hyper?

11:53.105 --> 11:54.561
You stinky repairman.

11:54.564 --> 11:57.601
I dare you! Use it here...


01:58:07.772 --> 01:58:09.057
Driving rules violated.
Deduct three points.

01:58:09.064 --> 01:58:11.225
Can you drive? Liu hu kou!

01:58:11.439 --> 01:58:14.511
Li yiyi! You're distracting
my vision with that bag!


01:58:14.564 --> 01:58:17.601
My fault?

01:58:17.605 --> 01:58:21.393
How am I blocking your vision
when I'm sitting behind you?

01:58:21.397 --> 01:58:24.719
This project will last for 100 generations.


01:58:26.147 --> 01:58:29.514
We are unaware of what the new sun
at 4.2 light years away

01:58:29.522 --> 01:58:31.353
will bring to our new home though.

01:58:31.355 --> 01:58:34.802
But from this day on.
The courage and perseverance of mankind


01:58:34.814 --> 01:58:37.180
will be etched among the stars.

01:58:37.522 --> 01:58:40.059
This long voyage of hope and despair.

01:58:40.064 --> 01:58:43.227
Enduring 2.500 years through the cosmos.

01:58:43.230 --> 01:58:44.515
Is known as

01:58:44.689 --> 01:58:47.726
the wandering earth project.








12:01.105 --> 12:02.311
Duoduo. Get down.












01:13.147 --> 01:15.138
There is an eye on Jupiter.

01:15.647 --> 01:17.603
That's a huge windstorm on Jupiter.

01:17.605 --> 01:19.470
What's a windstorm?

01:19.480 --> 01:21.971
Jupiter is like a huge balloon.

01:21.980 --> 01:24.187
Composed of 90% hydrogen.


12:09.189 --> 12:11.646
I want him dead!

12:13.439 --> 12:14.428
Dear friends.

12:14.439 --> 12:16.395
Let's open the door and embrace the spring.

12:16.689 --> 12:19.601
Joy shall follow you when you see one.












12:19.689 --> 12:20.644
A new year.

12:20.647 --> 12:22.638
With our heads up and walk tall.

12:22.689 --> 12:25.601
Marching toward to the
next spectacular chapter.












12:36.730 --> 12:38.311
- Excuse us.
- Excuse us.



12:42.939 --> 12:44.770
I dare you not to come back!

12:45.522 --> 12:46.522
What?

12:46.897 --> 12:48.228
Will they report us?

12:48.230 --> 12:49.811
These were obtained illegally.

12:49.814 --> 12:51.454
They'll expose themselves if they report.


12:53.064 --> 12:54.520
Well...

12:55.397 --> 12:56.978
This spring festival.

12:56.980 --> 12:59.016
You will spend it with me outside.


13:11.147 --> 13:15.390
Please check your thermal suit and helmet.
Please wait there.



13:22.147 --> 13:25.104
Miss. Can I chew gum with my helmet on?

13:25.105 --> 13:26.545
- Chew what?
- Shut up and come over!

13:31.647 --> 13:34.764
- In three days. We'll swing pass Jupiter.
- Attention!


13:35.147 --> 13:38.685
All transportation communication systems
must be turned on all the time.

13:38.855 --> 13:41.562
Follow evacuation instructions at any time.


13:52.105 --> 13:57.020
Please pay attention to reversing.


01:24.189 --> 01:26.805
Grandpa. What's hydrogen?

01:27.064 --> 01:28.304
What is hydrogen?

01:31.689 --> 01:33.020
Hydrogen is

01:33.022 --> 01:35.183
the fuel for dad's rocket.


14:01.480 --> 14:03.516
Oh. My.


14:08.105 --> 14:09.595
Look at yourself.

14:09.605 --> 14:11.220
Is it your first time outside. Too?

14:11.439 --> 14:13.054
Haven't you been outside before?

14:13.064 --> 14:15.646
It wasn't this crowded last time.


14:15.647 --> 14:17.512
You are such a liar.

14:19.189 --> 14:21.396
How long will it take
to get to the surface?

14:21.397 --> 14:23.103
It's 5 km.

14:23.105 --> 14:25.721
So at least 15 minutes.


14:25.730 --> 14:26.730
Okay.


14:38.772 --> 14:40.012
This is a communication device.

14:40.022 --> 14:41.808
Press once to sync with the transporter.

14:41.814 --> 14:43.179
Twice for regional broadcast.

14:43.189 --> 14:44.599
Three times for the private channel.

14:44.605 --> 14:45.594
Once outside.


14:45.605 --> 14:47.061
Stay close to me.

14:47.064 --> 14:48.224
Don't run around.

14:48.230 --> 14:49.436
Are you afraid?




15:20.772 --> 15:22.603
Surface level reached.

15:22.605 --> 15:25.677
All personnel. Please be ready.



01:35.189 --> 01:36.189
I see.

01:36.314 --> 01:37.474
Liu qi.

01:37.480 --> 01:38.480
Yes?

01:38.647 --> 01:39.978
A day may come

01:40.647 --> 01:43.605
when you can see Jupiter
without a telescope...

01:43.939 --> 01:45.270
That's when dad will come back.




16:00.689 --> 16:01.724
Let's go!

16:05.689 --> 16:07.395
Enough looking around?

16:07.397 --> 16:08.011
Let's go!

16:08.064 --> 16:09.224
I sneaked out.


16:09.230 --> 16:11.141
Am I getting expelled by the school?

16:11.147 --> 16:12.887
Have you already been
kicked out of your unit?

16:12.897 --> 16:15.138
Nonsense.

16:18.022 --> 16:20.729
Which one is transporter 373?


16:21.064 --> 16:23.055
Duoduo. Come over!

16:25.939 --> 16:28.055
- Give me grandpa's vehicle pass.
- Here.


16:35.647 --> 16:36.511
Han ziang.

16:36.522 --> 16:38.137
Senior driver.

16:38.147 --> 16:41.184
Beijing no. 3 transportation
division reminds you.


16:41.189 --> 16:42.975
Routes are countless.

16:42.980 --> 16:44.686
Safety is foremost.

16:44.772 --> 16:46.637
With unregulated driving.

16:46.689 --> 16:48.975
Your loved ones might end up in tears.


16:53.105 --> 16:54.140
Clutch.

16:54.439 --> 16:55.849
Gear.

17:00.480 --> 17:01.765
What the...


17:02.439 --> 17:03.849
Can you drive. Hu kou?

17:03.855 --> 17:05.811
This transporter is not for everyone!

17:05.814 --> 17:07.805
It requires at least
five years of training.

17:07.814 --> 17:09.679
I am genius enough just to make it move.
Okay?

17:09.689 --> 17:10.724
Genius.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.391
Step on the clutch. Hand on the gear.
Then move.


17:12.397 --> 17:14.513
Heavy step. Light hand and no commotion.

17:21.230 --> 17:22.590
Watch out! There are others ahead!
