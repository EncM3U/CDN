[00:10.61]Hey I was doing just fine before I met you
[00:14.74]I drink too much
[00:15.95]And that's an issue but I'm okay
[00:17.81]
[00:20.60]Hey you tell your friends
[00:23.46]It was nice to meet them
[00:24.86]But I hope I never see them again
[00:28.31]
[00:31.63]I know it breaks your heart
[00:33.17]Moved to the city in a broke down car
[00:35.28]And four years no calls
[00:37.56]
[00:38.15]Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
[00:40.37]And I I I can't stop
[00:43.34]
[00:45.61]No I can't stop
[00:48.40]
[00:50.50]So baby pull me closer
[00:52.23]
[00:52.78]In the backseat of your Rover
[00:54.72]
[00:55.36]That I know you can't afford
[00:57.12]
[00:57.88]Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
[00:59.75]
[01:00.32]Pull the sheets right off the corner
[01:02.36]
[01:02.91]Of the mattress that you stole
[01:04.64]
[01:05.39]From your roommate back in Boulder
[01:07.36]

[01:29.98]
[01:31.54]You look as good as the day I met you
[01:35.73]I forget just why I left you I was insane
[01:38.85]
[01:41.35]Stay and play that Blink 182 song
[01:45.90]That we beat to death in Tucson okay
[01:48.45]
[01:52.45]I know it breaks your heart
