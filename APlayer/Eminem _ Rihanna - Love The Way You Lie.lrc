[00:34.88]As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
[00:37.68]High off her love drunk from my hate
[00:39.56]It's like I'm huffin' paint
[00:40.67]And I love her the more I suffer I suffocate
[00:43.25]And right before I'm about to drown she resuscitates me
[00:46.36]She f**kin' hates me and I love it wait
