[00:00.00]The Technicolor Phase (¥Æ¥¯¥Ë¥«¥é©`&#12539;¥Õ¥§¥¤¥º) - Owl City (Ã¨Í·Ó¥Ö®³Ç)
[00:08.54]Written by£ºAdam Young
[00:17.08]I'm the red in the rose
[00:19.88]The flowers on the blankets on your bedroom floor
[00:23.75]
[00:25.10]And I'm the gray in the ghost
[00:27.87]That hides with your clothes behind your closet door
[00:32.72]
[00:33.75]I'm the green in the grass
[00:36.43]That bends back from underneath your feet
[00:40.39]
[00:41.85]And I'm the blue in your back alley view
[00:45.58]Where the horizon and the rooftops meet
[00:49.25]
[01:07.82]If you cut me I suppose I would bleed
[01:10.50]
[01:11.13]The colors of the evening stars
[01:14.21]
[01:15.64]You can go anywhere you wish
[01:18.85]Cuz I'll be there wherever you are
[01:22.20]
[01:22.85]Wherever you are
[01:23.78]
[01:57.36]I will always meet your gaze
[02:03.05]
[02:05.03]When we are lost in the technicolor phase
[02:11.04]
[02:13.89]I'm the black in the book
[02:16.09]
[02:16.69]The letters on the pages that you memorize
[02:21.00]
[02:21.86]And I'm the orange in the overcast
[02:25.42]
[02:25.97]A color that you visualize
[02:28.75]
[02:30.33]I'm the white in the walls
[02:33.40]That soak up all the sound when you cannot sleep
[02:37.06]
[02:38.69]And I'm the peach in the starfish on the beach
[02:42.29]That wish the harbor wasn't quite so deep
[02:46.68]
[03:04.61]If you cut me I suppose I would bleed
[03:07.09]
[03:07.80]The colors of the evening stars
[03:10.84]
[03:12.61]You can go anywhere you wish
[03:15.84]Cuz I'll be there wherever you are
[03:19.57]My darling
[03:20.45]
[03:28.15]Wherever you are
[03:29.36]
[03:44.66]Wherever you are
[03:45.92]
[03:53.48]Wherever you are
