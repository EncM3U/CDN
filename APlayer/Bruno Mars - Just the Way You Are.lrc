[00:17.90]Oh her eyes her eyes
[00:19.99]Make the stars look like they're not shinin'
[00:22.61]Her hair her hair
[00:24.33]Falls perfectly without her trying
[00:27.41]She's so beautiful
[00:29.86]And I tell her every day
[00:34.87]Yeah I know I know
[00:37.62]When I compliment her she won't believe me
[00:40.28]And it's so it's so
[00:41.92]Sad to think that she don't see what I see
[00:44.94]But every time she asks me "Do I look okay"
[00:48.23]I say
[00:51.79]When I see your face
[00:56.32]There's not a thing that I would change
[01:00.93]'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
[01:09.61]And when you smile
[01:14.01]The whole world stops and stares for a while
[01:18.37]'Cause girl you're amazing just the way you are
[01:28.70]Her lips her lips
[01:30.40]I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
[01:33.11]Her laugh her laugh
[01:34.77]She hates but I think it's so sexy
[01:37.83]She's so beautiful and I tell her every day
[01:45.23]Oh you know you know you know
[01:47.56]I'd never ask you to change
[01:50.19]If perfect's what you're searching for
[01:52.39]Then just stay the same
[01:54.54]So don't even bother asking if you look okay
[01:58.53]You know I'll say
[02:02.15]When I see your face
[02:06.81]There's not a thing that I would change
[02:11.40]'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
[02:20.02]And when you smile
[02:24.37]The whole world stops and stares for a while
[02:28.82]'Cause girl you're amazing just the way you are
[02:37.31]The way you are
[02:41.65]The way you are
[02:46.63]Girl you're amazing just the way you are
[02:54.87]When I see your face
[02:59.64]There's not a thing that I would change
[03:04.22]'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
[03:12.81]And when you smile
[03:17.17]The whole world stops and stares for a while
[03:21.55]'Cause girl you're amazing just the way you are yeah
