[00:22.01]You would not believe your eyes
[00:24.53]If ten million fireflies
[00:27.22]Lit up the world as I fell asleep
[00:32.58]'Cause they'd fill the open air
[00:35.18]And leave teardrops everywhere
[00:37.39]You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare
[00:43.23]I'd like to make myself believe
[00:47.17]That planet Earth turns slowly
[00:53.30]It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
[00:58.73]'Cause everything is never as it seems
[01:04.46]'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
[01:07.08]From ten thousand lightning bugs
[01:09.62]As they tried to teach me how to dance
[01:15.19]A foxtrot above my head
[01:17.83]A sock hop beneath my bed
[01:19.92]The disco ball is just hanging by a thread
[01:26.08]I'd like to make myself believe
[01:29.95]That planet Earth turns slowly
[01:36.05]It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
[01:41.45]'Cause everything is never as it seems
[01:45.62]When I fall asleep
[01:49.86]Leave my door open just a crack
[01:52.79]Please take me away from here
[01:55.12]'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
[01:58.37]Please take me away from here
[02:00.75]Why do I tire of counting sheep
[02:03.65]Please take me away from here
[02:05.98]When I'm far too tired to fall asleep
[02:09.28]Haha
[02:11.33]To ten million fireflies
[02:13.87]I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
[02:16.28]I got misty eyes as they said farewell
[02:19.57]Said farewell
[02:21.81]But I'll know where several are
[02:24.23]If my dreams get real bizarre
[02:26.48]'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar
[02:30.21]Jar jar jar
[02:32.69]I'd like to make myself believe
[02:36.76]That planet Earth turns slowly
[02:42.62]It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
[02:47.93]'Cause everything is never as it seems
[02:52.40]When I fall asleep
[02:53.89]I'd like to make myself believe
[02:57.85]That planet Earth turns slowly
[03:04.03]It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
[03:09.36]'Cause everything is never as it seems
[03:13.71]When I fall asleep
[03:15.36]I'd like to make myself believe
[03:19.24]That planet Earth turns slowly
[03:25.52]It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
[03:30.77]Because my dreams are bursting at the seams
