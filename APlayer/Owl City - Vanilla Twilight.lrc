[00:00.00]Vanilla Twilight (Ïã²Ý»Æ»è) - Owl City (Ã¨Í·Ó¥Ö®³Ç)
[00:00.83]The stars lean down to kiss you
[00:02.89]And I lie awake and miss you
[00:06.01]Pour me a heavy dose of atmosphere
[00:10.31]
[00:11.75]'Cause I'll doze off safe and soundly
[00:14.54]But I'll miss your arms around me
[00:17.60]I'd send a postcard to you dear
[00:20.72]'Cause I wish you were here
[00:22.89]
[00:46.75]I'll watch the night turn light blue
[00:49.37]But it's not the same without you
[00:52.08]Because it takes two to whisper quietly
[00:55.87]
[00:58.07]The silence isn't so bad
[01:00.94]Till I look at my hands and feel sad
[01:03.88]'Cause the spaces between my fingers
[01:06.28]Are right where yours fit perfectly
[01:09.71]I'll find repose in new ways
[01:12.40]Though I haven't slept in two days
[01:15.33]'Cause cold nostalgia chills me to the bone
[01:19.87]
[01:21.19]But drenched in vanilla twilight
[01:24.00]I'll sit on the front porch all night
[01:26.80]Waist-deep in thought because when I think of you
[01:30.79]I don't feel so alone
[01:33.47]
[01:36.47]I don't feel so alone
[01:40.64]
[01:42.16]I don't feel so alone
[01:47.08]
[01:49.65]As many times as I blink
[01:53.02]I'll think of you tonight
[02:01.24]
[02:11.36]I'll think of you tonight
[02:16.03]
[02:24.85]When violet eyes get brighter
[02:27.71]And heavy wings grow lighter
[02:30.58]I'll taste the sky and feel alive again
[02:35.25]
[02:36.39]And I'll forget the world that I knew
[02:39.26]But I swear I won't forget you
[02:42.06]Oh if my voice could reach back through the past
[02:45.87]I'll whisper in your ear
[02:48.73]
[02:50.36]Oh darling I wish you were here
